Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.Thanx is fundamentally changing that. Thanx personalizes every interaction between a merchant and their best customers, resulting in measurable increases in revenue for merchants and far greater personalization for consumers. How?
•	Through proprietary partnerships with credit card networks (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Amex), Thanx can reward consumers for their purchases and deliver highly-customized promotions
•	Through our interactive dashboard, Thanx makes even the smallest marketing team a data-science driven expert in personalization - right message to the right customer at the right time through the right channel.
•	By measuring our success based on revenue generated (not opens and clicks of emails)Think of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital).Thanx Engineering

We want to build intelligent multi-step campaigns that educate and inform prospects as the first introduction to our company, explore new campaign platforms and make smart data-driven decisions about what to pursue.I realize marketing jobs aren't usually what gets posted here, but the people who have really thrived at Varonis are both really technical (a third of the marketing team are full stack devs who moved into marketing, myself included) and adept at marketing.

REMOTEWork at a YC startup trying to fix healthcare! Or at least improve a small part of it.Bagel is a new electronic health record for the growing number of doctors that don't accept insurance, particularly direct primary care (DPC) docs. DPC is trying to cut insurance out of primary care. It makes no sense to use insurance to pay for basic or routine medical services; do you use your car insurance to pay for an oil change? There are some seriously great knock-on benefits of getting rid of insurance too. Here's a good rundown: https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2018/09/25/direct-primary...We're still in the early design phase, and we'll be starting implementation soon. We'll hit the ground running; I'd like to get a usable version out within three months.Here's the tentative stack: Typescript, React, Apollo Client, backend on Google Cloud (App Engine, probably), GraphQL, Postgres (+ Sequelize or similar). Ideally you'd be awesome at a few of these and competent in the rest.I'm Colin McDonnell, MIT EECS 2016, the sole founder of Bagel, and all-around nice person.
