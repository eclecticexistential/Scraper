Anarchism

Anarchism is a <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a> that advocates <a href="Self-governance">self-governed</a> societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as <a href="Stateless%20society">stateless societies</a>, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-<a href="Hierarchy">hierarchical</a> or <a href="Free%20association%20%28communism%20and%20anarchism%29">free associations</a>. Anarchism holds the <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a> to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.

While <a href="Anti-statism">opposition to the state</a> is central, anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations. Anarchism is usually considered a <a href="Far-left%20politics">far-left</a> ideology and much of <a href="anarchist%20economics">anarchist economics</a> and <a href="Anarchist%20law">anarchist legal philosophy</a> reflects <a href="Libertarian%20socialism">anti-authoritarian interpretations</a> of <a href="Anarcho-communism">communism</a>, <a href="Collectivist%20anarchism">collectivism</a>, <a href="Anarcho-syndicalism">syndicalism</a>, <a href="Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29">mutualism</a>, or <a href="participatory%20economics">participatory economics</a>.

Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive. <a href="Anarchist%20schools%20of%20thought">Anarchist schools of thought</a> can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme <a href="individualism">individualism</a> to complete <a href="collectivism">collectivism</a>. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of <a href="Social%20anarchism">social</a> and <a href="individualist%20anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> or similar dual classifications.

The word "<a href="wikt%3Aanarchism">anarchism</a>" is composed from the word "<a href="anarchy">anarchy</a>" and the suffix <a href="-ism">-ism</a>, themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. "anarchy" (from , "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the <a href="privative">privative</a> prefix <a href="privative%20alpha">ἀν</a>- ("an-", i.e. "without") and , "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf. "<a href="archon">archon</a>" or , "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix or ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal <a href="infinitive">infinitive</a> suffix , "-izein"). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> labelled opponents as anarchists (as <a href="Maximilien%20Robespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a> did the <a href="H%C3%A9bertists">Hébertists</a>) although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Weitling">Wilhelm Weitling</a>, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, the term "<a href="libertarianism">libertarianism</a>" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only, referring to free market anarchism as <a href="libertarian%20anarchism">libertarian anarchism</a>.

The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC among the works of <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> philosopher <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a> and in later centuries by <a href="Zhuang%20Zhou">Zhuangzi</a> and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote: "A petty thief is put in jail. A great <a href="wikt%3Abrigand">brigand</a> becomes a ruler of a Nation". <a href="Diogenes%20of%20Sinope">Diogenes of Sinope</a> and the <a href="Cynicism%20%28philosophy%29">Cynics</a> as well as their contemporary <a href="Zeno%20of%20Citium">Zeno of Citium</a>, the founder of <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>, also introduced similar topics. <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the <a href="Christian%20anarchism">Christian anarchist</a> tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote: "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and [...] the first anarchist society was that of the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">apostles</a>". In early <a href="History%20of%20Islam">Islamic history</a>, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the <a href="Second%20Fitna">Islamic civil war</a> over the <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>, where the <a href="Kharijites">Kharijites</a> insisted that the <a href="imamate">imamate</a> is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.
The French <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">Renaissance</a> political philosopher <a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20La%20Bo%C3%A9tie">Étienne de La Boétie</a> wrote in his most famous work the "<a href="Discourse%20on%20Voluntary%20Servitude">Discourse on Voluntary Servitude</a>" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. The radical <a href="Protestant%20Christianity">Protestant Christian</a> <a href="Gerrard%20Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a> and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642 during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> as a <a href="Pejorative">term of abuse</a>, used by <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a> against their <a href="Roundhead">Roundhead</a> opponents. By the time of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, some such as the <a href="Enrag%C3%A9s">Enraged Ones</a> began to use the term positively in opposition to <a href="Jacobin%20%28politics%29">Jacobin</a> centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as <a href="oxymoron">oxymoron</a>ic. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.

Modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, particularly <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought. According to <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>, Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work" while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>.

Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as <a href="philosophical%20anarchism">philosophical anarchism</a>. He argued in "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people's "mental enslavement" the foundations of law, <a href="property%20rights">property rights</a> and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.

The French <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work "<a href="What%20is%20Property%3F">What is Property?</a>", published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of <a href="spontaneous%20order">spontaneous order</a> in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". In "What is Property?", Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "<a href="Property%20is%20theft">Property is theft</a>". In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called "possession", or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. However, Proudhon later added that "Property is Liberty" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion and certain <a href="capitalist">capitalist</a> practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

The <a href="Anarcho-communism">anarcho-communist</a> <a href="Joseph%20D%C3%A9jacque">Joseph Déjacque</a> was the first person to describe himself as "<a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a>". Unlike Proudhon, he argued that "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature". In 1844, the <a href="post-Hegelian">post-Hegelian</a> philosopher <a href="Max%20Stirner">Max Stirner</a> published in Germany the book, "<a href="The%20Ego%20and%20Its%20Own">The Ego and Its Own</a>", which would later be considered an influential early text of <a href="individualist%20anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>. French anarchists active in the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">1848 Revolution</a> included <a href="Anselme%20Bellegarrigue">Anselme Bellegarrigue</a>, Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque and Proudhon himself.
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the <a href="revolutions%20of%201848">revolutions of 1848</a>, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, <a href="conservative">conservative</a> elements took advantage of the divided groups of <a href="Socialism">socialists</a>, <a href="Liberalism">liberals</a> and <a href="Nationalism">nationalists</a> along with anarchists to prevent further revolt. In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal "El Porvenir" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas. The Catalan politician <a href="Francesc%20Pi%20i%20Margall">Francesc Pi i Margall</a> became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became President of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the <a href="Federal%20Democratic%20Republican%20Party">Federal Democratic Republican Party</a>. According to George Woodcock: "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's". According to the "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>": "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall <a href="Cantonal%20Revolution">attempted to establish a decentralised, or "cantonalist," political system</a> on Proudhonian lines".

In 1864, the <a href="International%20Workingmen%27s%20Association">International Workingmen's Association</a> (sometimes called the First International) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, <a href="Blanquism">Blanquists</a>, <a href="Philadelphes">Philadelphes</a>, English trade unionists, socialists and <a href="Social%20democracy">social democrats</a>. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the <a href="Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29">mutualists</a>, opposed Marx's <a href="state%20socialism">state socialism</a>, advocating political <a href="abstentionism">abstentionism</a> and small property holdings. Woodcock also reports that the <a href="Individualist%20anarchism%20in%20the%20United%20States">American individualist anarchists</a> <a href="Lysander%20Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a> and <a href="William%20Batchelder%20Greene">William Batchelder Greene</a> had been members of the First International. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the <a href="League%20of%20Peace%20and%20Freedom">League of Peace and Freedom</a> (LPF) Russian revolutionary <a href="Mikhail%20Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and his <a href="collectivist%20anarchist">collectivist anarchist</a> associates joined the First International, which had decided not to get involved with the LPF. They allied themselves with the <a href="federalist">federalist</a> socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property. At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as <a href="centralism">centralist</a> and predicted that if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the <a href="ruling%20class">ruling class</a> they had fought against.

Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports: "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers". In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the <a href="Hague%20Congress%20%281872%29">Hague Congress</a>, where Bakunin and <a href="James%20Guillaume">James Guillaume</a> were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the <a href="Anarchist%20St.%20Imier%20International">St. Imier Congress</a>, adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.

The <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune</a> was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included <a href="Louise%20Michel">Louise Michel</a>, the Reclus brothers (<a href="%C3%89lie%20Reclus">Élie Reclus</a> and <a href="%C3%89lis%C3%A9e%20Reclus">Élisée Reclus</a>) and <a href="Eugene%20Varlin">Eugene Varlin</a> (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised. Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. The Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 and for federation of communes), thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. George Woodcock states that "a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elisée Reclus and Louise Michel".

The <a href="Anti-authoritarianism">anti-authoritarian</a> sections of the First International were the precursors of the <a href="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalists</a>, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labour". In 1886, the <a href="Federation%20of%20Organized%20Trades%20and%20Labor%20Unions">Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</a> of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 as the date by which the <a href="Eight-hour%20day">eight-hour work day</a> would become standard.
In response, unions across the United States prepared a <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> in support of the event. On 3 May, a fight broke out in Chicago when <a href="strikebreaker">strikebreaker</a>s attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day on 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the <a href="Haymarket%20affair">Haymarket affair</a> and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890, a second attempt—this time international in scope—to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of <a href="International%20Workers%27%20Day">International Workers' Day</a> on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.

In 1907, the <a href="International%20Anarchist%20Congress%20of%20Amsterdam">International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam</a> gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which were important figures of the anarchist movement, including <a href="Errico%20Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Monatte">Pierre Monatte</a>, <a href="Luigi%20Fabbri">Luigi Fabbri</a>, <a href="Beno%C3%AEt%20Broutchoux">Benoît Broutchoux</a>, <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, <a href="Rudolf%20Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a> and <a href="Christiaan%20Cornelissen">Christiaan Cornelissen</a>. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, <a href="popular%20education">popular education</a> issues, the general strike or <a href="antimilitarism">antimilitarism</a>. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and <a href="syndicalism">syndicalism</a> (or <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a <a href="social%20revolution">social revolution</a> while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade union movement was <a href="reformism">reformist</a> and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.

In 1881, the <a href="Federaci%C3%B3n%20Anarquista%20Ib%C3%A9rica">Spanish Workers Federation</a> was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement—anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</a> (National Confederation of Labour, CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The CNT was affiliated with the <a href="International%20Workers%20Association">International Workers Association</a>, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular, "[t]he anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organisations was the <a href="Federaci%C3%B3n%20Obrera%20Regional%20Argentina">Federación Obrera Regional Argentina</a> [...] it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions".
Some anarchists, such as <a href="Johann%20Most">Johann Most</a>, advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda". Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder, but <a href="targeted%20killings">targeted killings</a> of members of the <a href="ruling%20class">ruling class</a> at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed. However, Most himself once boasted that "the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion". Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885, "The Science of Revolutionary Warfare", a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey.

By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, <a href="regicide">regicide</a>s and <a href="tyrannicide">tyrannicide</a>s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal "<a href="Confiscation">expropriations</a>". <a href="Illegalism">Illegalism</a> as a practice emerged and within it "[t]he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("<a href="propaganda%20by%20the%20deed">propaganda by the deed</a>") and the anarchist burglars ("<a href="individual%20reappropriation">individual reappropriation</a>") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt". France's <a href="Bonnot%20Gang">Bonnot Gang</a> was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts as soon as 1887. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist <a href="Fernand%20Pelloutier">Fernand Pelloutier</a> argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter".

<a href="Political%20repression">State repression</a> (including the infamous 1894 French "<a href="lois%20sc%C3%A9l%C3%A9rates">lois scélérates</a>") of the anarchist and <a href="labour%20movement">labour movement</a>s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed in the first place to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French <a href="socialist%20movement">socialist movement</a> into many groups and—following the suppression of the 1871—Paris Commune the execution and exile of many "<a href="communards">communards</a>" to <a href="penal%20colonies">penal colonies</a> favoured individualist political expression and acts.

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>, President <a href="Marie%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Sadi%20Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> of France, Prime Minister <a href="Antonio%20C%C3%A1novas%20del%20Castillo">Antonio Cánovas del Castillo</a> of Spain, <a href="Empress%20Elisabeth%20of%20Austria">Empress Elisabeth of Austria</a>, King <a href="Umberto%20I%20of%20Italy">Umberto I of Italy</a>, President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> of the United States, King <a href="Carlos%20I%20of%20Portugal">Carlos I of Portugal</a> and King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">George I of Greece</a>. McKinley's assassin <a href="Leon%20Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a> claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and <a href="Feminism">feminist</a> Emma Goldman.

Anarchists participated alongside the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s in both <a href="February%20Revolution">February</a> and <a href="October%20Revolution">October revolutions</a> and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution. However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 <a href="Kronstadt%20rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. In the <a href="Free%20Territory">Free Territory</a>, they fought in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> against the <a href="White%20movement">Whites</a> (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Bakunin's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example and <a href="Communist%20party">communist parties</a> grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the <a href="General%20Confederation%20of%20Labour%20%28France%29">General Confederation of Labour</a> and <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW) left the organisations and joined the <a href="Comintern">Communist International</a>.

The <a href="Revolutions%20of%201917%E2%80%931923">revolutionary wave of 1917–1923</a> saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">German Revolution of 1918–19</a>19 which established the <a href="Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Bavarian Soviet Republic</a>, the anarchists <a href="Gustav%20Landauer">Gustav Landauer</a>, <a href="Silvio%20Gesell">Silvio Gesell</a> and <a href="Erich%20M%C3%BChsam">Erich Mühsam</a> had important leadership positions within the revolutionary <a href="Council%20communism">councilist</a> structures. In the Italian events known as the "<a href="biennio%20rosso">biennio rosso</a>", the anarcho-syndicalist trade union <a href="Unione%20Sindacale%20Italiana">Unione Sindacale Italiana</a> "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "<a href="Umanita%20Nova">Umanita Nova</a>", its daily paper) grew accordingly [...] Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces." In the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>, the <a href="Mexican%20Liberal%20Party">Mexican Liberal Party</a> was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a> with the leadership of anarcho-communist <a href="Ricardo%20Flores%20Mag%C3%B3n">Ricardo Flores Magón</a>.

In Paris, the <a href="Dielo%20Truda">Dielo Truda</a> group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the "<a href="Platformism">Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)</a>", was supported. <a href="Platformist">Platformist</a> groups active today include the <a href="Workers%20Solidarity%20Movement">Workers Solidarity Movement</a> in Ireland and the <a href="NEFAC">North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists</a> of North America. <a href="Synthesis%20anarchism">Synthesis anarchism</a> emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of <a href="anarchism%20without%20adjectives">anarchism without adjectives</a>. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents <a href="Volin">Volin</a> and <a href="Sebastien%20Faure">Sebastien Faure</a>. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a>.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of <a href="fascism%20in%20Europe">fascism in Europe</a> transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s <a href="Fascism">fascists</a>. Italian anarchists played a key role in the <a href="Anti-fascism">anti-fascist</a> organisation "<a href="Arditi%20del%20Popolo">Arditi del Popolo</a>", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling <a href="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</a> in the anarchist stronghold of <a href="Parma">Parma</a> in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution". In France, where the <a href="far-right%20leagues">far-right leagues</a> came close to insurrection in the <a href="6%20February%201934%20crisis">February 1934 riots</a>, anarchists divided over a <a href="united%20front">united front</a> policy.

<a href="Anarchism%20in%20France">Anarchists in France</a> and <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Italy">Italy</a> were active in the <a href="Resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II">Resistance during World War II</a>. In Germany, the anarchist <a href="Erich%20M%C3%BChsam">Erich Mühsam</a> was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the <a href="Reichstag%20fire">Reichstag fire</a> in Berlin. <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi</a> <a href="Reich%20Ministry%20of%20Public%20Enlightenment%20and%20Propaganda">propaganda minister</a>, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives". Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at <a href="Sonnenburg">Sonnenburg</a>, Brandenburg and finally, <a href="Oranienburg">Oranienburg</a>. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">concentration camp</a> at <a href="Oranienburg%20concentration%20camp">Oranienburg</a> when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.

In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Spain">anarchist-inspired</a> movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and of large areas of rural Spain where they <a href="Collective%20farming">collectivised</a> the land. However, the anarchists were losing ground even before the fascist victory in 1939 in a bitter struggle with the <a href="Stalinism">Stalinists</a>, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the <a href="Republican%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Republicans</a> cause from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. According to <a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, "the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere. The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Republic</a> and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a> still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. That failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves". The events known as the <a href="Spanish%20Revolution%20of%201936">Spanish Revolution</a> was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly <a href="Libertarian%20socialism">libertarian socialist</a> organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, <a href="Anarchist%20Aragon">Aragon</a>, <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> and parts of <a href="Levante%2C%20Spain">Levante</a>. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Spain">Communist Party of Spain</a> influence as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, <a href="Agriculture">agrarian</a> areas became collectivised and run as libertarian <a href="commune">commune</a>s. Anarchist historian <a href="Sam%20Dolgoff">Sam Dolgoff</a> estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history". Spanish Communist Party-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both <a href="POUM">dissident Marxists</a> and anarchists. The prominent Italian anarchist <a href="Camillo%20Berneri">Camillo Berneri</a>, who volunteered to fight against <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party. The city of <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> was turned over to the Francoist forces by the last non-francoist mayor of the city, the anarchist <a href="Melchor%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Garc%C3%ADa">Melchor Rodríguez García</a>.

Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Italy%23Postwar%20years%20and%20today">anarchist movements of Italy</a> and <a href="Anarchism%20in%20France%23The%20Fourth%20Republic%20%281945%E2%80%931958%29">France</a>. The <a href="Mexican%20Anarchist%20Federation">Mexican Anarchist Federation</a> was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District. In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime. In 1945 in France the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Anarchiste">Fédération Anarchiste</a> and the anarchosyndicalist trade union <a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20nationale%20du%20travail">Confédération nationale du travail</a> was established in the next year while the also <a href="Synthesist%20anarchism">synthesist</a> <a href="Federazione%20Anarchica%20Italiana">Federazione Anarchica Italiana</a> was founded in Italy. Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the <a href="Japanese%20Anarchist%20Federation">Japanese Anarchist Federation</a> was founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948. After World War II, an appeal in the "<a href="Fraye%20Arbeter%20Shtime">Fraye Arbeter Shtime</a>" detailing the plight of <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Germany">German anarchists</a> and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ, "Die Freie Gesellschaft", which survived until 1953. In 1956, the <a href="Uruguayan%20Anarchist%20Federation">Uruguayan Anarchist Federation</a> was founded. In 1955, the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the <a href="Argentine%20Libertarian%20Federation">Argentine Libertarian Federation</a>. The <a href="Syndicalist%20Workers%27%20Federation">Syndicalist Workers' Federation</a> (SWF) was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of <a href="Solidarity%20Federation">Solidarity Federation</a>'s earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain (AFB). Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.

Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Read">Herbert Read</a>, Paul Goodman, Dwight Macdonald, <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>, George Woodcock, <a href="Leopold%20Kohr">Leopold Kohr</a>, <a href="Julian%20Beck">Julian Beck</a>, <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a> and the French <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist</a> group led by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breton">André Breton</a>, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.

<a href="Anarcho-pacifism">Anarcho-pacifism</a> became influential in the <a href="Anti-nuclear%20movement">Anti-nuclear movement</a> and <a href="anti%20war%20movement">anti war movement</a>s of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of <a href="Campaign%20for%20Nuclear%20Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> <a href="Alex%20Comfort">Alex Comfort</a> or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists <a href="Ammon%20Hennacy">Ammon Hennacy</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Day">Dorothy Day</a>. Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>". The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's , "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".

A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the <a href="Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">Counterculture of the 1960s</a> and anarchists actively participated in the <a href="Protests%20of%201968">late sixties students and workers revolts</a>. In 1968, in <a href="Carrara">Carrara</a>, Italy the <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a> was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20anarchiste">Fédération Anarchiste</a>), the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the <a href="Iberian%20Anarchist%20Federation">Iberian Anarchist Federation</a> as well as the <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>n federation in French exile.

In the United Kingdom in the 1970s, this was associated with the <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> movement as exemplified by bands such as <a href="Crass">Crass</a> and the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, <a href="squatter">squatter</a>s occupied a disused military base and declared the <a href="Freetown%20Christiania">Freetown Christiania</a>, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid-20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of <a href="anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</a>, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist <a href="David%20Graeber">David Graeber</a> and anarchist historian <a href="Andrej%20Grubacic">Andrej Grubacic</a> have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by <a href="Traditional%20knowledge">indigenous</a>, <a href="Feminism">feminist</a>, ecological and cultural-critical ideas" and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.

Since the 1980s, anarchism has grown into a strong political force in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, with the development of <a href="Fejuve">Fejuve</a> (1979), <a href="CIPO-RFM">CIPO-RFM</a> (1980s), <a href="Rebel%20Zapatista%20Autonomous%20Municipalities">Zapatistas</a> (1994), <a href="December%202001%20riots%20in%20Argentina">Horizontilidad</a> (2001) and the <a href="2006%20Oaxaca%20protests">Oaxaca Uprising</a> (2006). Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and <a href="anti-globalisation%20movement">anti-globalisation movement</a>s. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO), <a href="Group%20of%20Eight">Group of Eight</a> (G8) and the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a> (WEF). Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as <a href="black%20bloc">black bloc</a>s—other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include <a href="security%20culture">security culture</a>, <a href="affinity%20group">affinity group</a>s and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization%20Ministerial%20Conference%20of%201999%20protest%20activity">WTO conference in Seattle in 1999</a>. According to anarchist scholar <a href="Simon%20Critchley">Simon Critchley</a>, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary <a href="neo-liberalism">neo-liberalism</a> [...] One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally".
International anarchist federations in existence include the <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a>, the <a href="International%20Workers%27%20Association">International Workers' Association</a> and <a href="International%20Libertarian%20Solidarity">International Libertarian Solidarity</a>. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the <a href="Confederacion%20General%20del%20Trabajo%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Confederación General del Trabajo</a> (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.

Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the <a href="Democratic%20Federation%20of%20Northern%20Syria">Democratic Federation of Northern Syria</a> (DFNS), more commonly known as <a href="Rojava">Rojava</a>, a "de facto" <a href="Permanent%20autonomous%20zone">autonomous region</a> in northern <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. <a href="Abdullah%20%C3%96calan">Abdullah Öcalan</a>—a founding member of the <a href="Kurdistan%20Workers%27%20Party">Kurdistan Workers' Party</a> (PKK) who is currently imprisoned in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>—is an iconic and popular figure in the DFNS whose ideas shaped the region's society and politics. While in prison, Öcalan corresponded with (and was influenced by) <a href="Murray%20Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>, an <a href="anarcho-communist">anarcho-communist</a> theorist and philosopher who developed <a href="Communalism">Communalism</a> and <a href="libertarian%20municipalism">libertarian municipalism</a>. Modelled after Bookchin's ideas, Öcalan developed the theory of <a href="democratic%20confederalism">democratic confederalism</a>. In March 2005, he issued his "Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan", calling upon citizens "to stop attacking the government and instead create municipal assemblies, which he called '<a href="Social%20anarchism">democracy without the state</a>'".

<a href="Anarchist%20schools%20of%20thought">Anarchist schools of thought</a> had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, <a href="individualist%20anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> and <a href="social%20anarchism">social anarchism</a>, which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises <a href="negative%20liberty">negative liberty</a>, i.e. opposition to state or <a href="social%20control">social control</a> over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise <a href="positive%20liberty">positive liberty</a> to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, "recognising equality of entitlement". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools—those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is <a href="philosophical%20anarchism">philosophical anarchism</a>, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a <a href="Minarchism">minimal state</a> as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a <a href="moral%20obligation">moral obligation</a> to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "anarchism without adjectives", a call for <a href="toleration">toleration</a> first adopted by <a href="Fernando%20Tarrida%20del%20M%C3%A1rmol">Fernando Tarrida del Mármol</a> in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the <a href="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.

<a href="Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29">Mutualism</a> began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order." Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers' movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned <a href="cooperative">cooperative</a>s, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with <a href="Reciprocity%20%28cultural%20anthropology%29">reciprocity</a>, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist <a href="William%20Batchelder%20Greene">William Batchelder Greene</a>, each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount". Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property".

<a href="Social%20anarchism">Social anarchism</a> calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or <a href="coercion">coercion</a>. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism. Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for <a href="personal%20property">personal property</a>) and emphasises cooperation and [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].

[[Collectivist anarchism]], also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most. Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or propaganda by the deed, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.

However, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system". Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]], but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not [[mutually exclusive]]—although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.

[[File:Kropotkin2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Kropotkin]] was influential in the development of [[anarcho-communism]]]]
[[Anarcho-communism]] (also known as anarchist-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, [[market (economics)|markets]], money, [[private property]] (while retaining respect for personal property) and capitalism in favour of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], [[direct democracy]] and a horizontal network of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".

Some forms of anarchist communism such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]] are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.

Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French Revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections. To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e. established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] and the [[Free Territory]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Through the efforts and influence of the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]] during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of [[Revolutionary Catalonia|anarchist Catalonia]] before being crushed by the combined forces of the [[Francoist Spain|regime that won the war]], Hitler, Mussolini, Communist Party of Spain repression (backed by the Soviet Union) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend—through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine—anarcho-communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.

[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|[[International Workers' Day|May Day]] 2010 demonstration of Spanish [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in Bilbao, Basque Country]]
[[Anarcho-syndicalism]] is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement. Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves. Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"—rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-Syndicalism". The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish CNT played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.

[[Individualist anarchism]] refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy, but it instead refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, William Godwin, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote "[[Political Justice]]", which some consider the first expression of anarchism. Godwin was a philosophical anarchist and from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.

[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Stirner]] (here in a sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]) is usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist]]
An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism", or [[egoist anarchism]], was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German [[Max Stirner]]. Stirner's "[[The Ego and Its Own]]", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality. To Stirner, rights were "[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]" in the mind and he held that society does not exist, but "the individuals are its reality". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw [[Union of egoists|unions of egoists]], non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. "Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and [[homosexual]] activist [[John Henry Mackay]].

[[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, "[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]] [...] William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form". [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books "[[Walden]]", a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, as well as his essay, "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Benjamin Tucker later fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication "[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]".

From these early influences, individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals, [[free love]] and [[birth control]] advocates (see [[anarchism and issues related to love and sex]]), individualist [[naturist]]s and [[nudist]]s (see [[anarcho-naturism]]), [[freethought]] and [[anti-clerical]] activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and [[individual reclamation]] (see [[European individualist anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism in France]]). These authors and activists included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Emile Armand]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Henri Zisly]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]], [[Adolf Brand]] and [[Lev Chernyi]] among others.

[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lawrence Jarach]] (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right), two prominent [[Contemporary anarchism|contemporary anarchist]] authors: Zerzan is known as prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] while Jarach is a noted advocate of [[post-left anarchy]]]]
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]], combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.

[[Insurrectionary anarchism]] is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises [[insurrection]] within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organisations such as [[labour unions]] and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small [[affinity group]] based organisation. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]] and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.

[[Green anarchism]] (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]]. Writing from a green anarchist perspective, [[John Zerzan]] attributes the ills of today's social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization. While [[Layla AbdelRahim]] argues that "the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies, whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby institutionalize violence". Thus, according to her, civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics. Language and literacy, she claims, are some of these technologies.

[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist". Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see [[non-violence]]). It developed mostly in the Netherlands, Britain and the United States before and during the Second World War. Christian anarchism is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines anarchism and Christianity. Its main proponents included [[Leo Tolstoy]], Dorothy Day, Ammon Hennacy and [[Jacques Ellul]].

[[Religious anarchism]] refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of (organized) religions, but many anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to [[organized religion]]. Many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism, most notably Christianity as Christian anarchists believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy. Non-Christian forms of religious anarchism include [[Buddhist anarchism]], [[Jewish anarchism]] and most recently [[Neopaganism]].

[[Synthesis anarchism]] is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the [[anarcho-communists]] [[Voline]] and [[Sébastien Faure]]. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global [[International of Anarchist Federations]].

[[Platformism]] is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda's "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)". The document was based on the experiences of [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchists]] in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The "Platform" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.

[[Post-left anarchy]] is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional [[left-wing politics]]. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general also presenting a critique of organisations and [[morality]]. Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist [[Situationist International]], post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.

[[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-left anarchy, [[postmodernism]], [[autonomism]], [[postcolonialism]] and the [[Situationist International]].

[[Queer anarchism]] is a form of [[socialism]] which suggests anarchism as a solution to the issues faced by the [[LGBT community]], mainly [[heteronormativity]], [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]] and [[biphobia]]. Anarcho-queer arose during the late 20th century based on the work of Michel Foucault "[[The History of Sexuality]]".

[[Left-wing market anarchism]] strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labour positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.

[[Anarcho-capitalism]] advocates the elimination of the state in favour of [[self-ownership]] in a [[free market]]. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from [[Austrian School]] economics, study of [[law and economics]] and [[public choice theory]]. There is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as [[Anarchism and capitalism|incompatible]] with capitalist forms.

[[Anarcho-transhumanism]] is a recently new branch of anarchism that takes traditional and modern anarchism, typically drawing from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[left-libertarianism]] or [[Libertarian socialist|libertarian socialism]] and combines it with [[transhumanism]] and [[post-humanism]]. It can be described as a "liberal democratic revolution, at its core the idea that people are happiest when they have rational control over their lives. Reason, science, and technology provide one kind of control, slowly freeing us from ignorance, toil, pain, disease and limited lifespans (aging)". Some anarcho-transhumanists might also follow [[technogaianism]].

[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|left|Which forms of violence (if any) are [[anarchism and violence|consistent with anarchist values]] is a controversial subject among anarchists]]

Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought and as such disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]], [[syndicalism]]/[[trade unionism]] and [[capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism) and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.

[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[Anarchism in France|Parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]
An important current within anarchism is [[free love]]. Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women, see for example marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. The most important American free love journal was "[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]" (1883–1907), edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]], but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's "[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]" (1872–1890, 1892–1893). "[[Free Society]]" (1895–1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897–1904 as "Free Society") was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The publication advocated free love and women's rights and critiqued "[[Comstockery]]"—i.e. censorship of sexual information. Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.

In New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman, among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public". Before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based [[German language]] journal "Der arme Teufel" (English: The Poor Devil). In Argentina, anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] published the newspaper called "" (English: "The Woman's Voice"), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897 and was revived briefly in 1901.

In Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand. He proposed the concept of "la camaraderie amoureuse" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]]. In Germany, the [[Stirnerism|Stirnerists]] Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. [[Mujeres Libres]] was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], Mercedes Comaposada and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. Lucía Sánchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her [[lesbian]]ism. She was published in a variety of literary journals while working under a male pen name, she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to [[censorship]] and punishment.

More recently, the British anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual "[[The Joy of Sex]]". The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as "Théorie du corps amoureux. Pour une érotique solaire" (2000) and "L'invention du plaisir. Fragments cyréaniques" (2002).

[[File:Francisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Anarchism in Spain|Catalan anarchist]] pedagogue and [[Freethought|free thinker]]]]
For English anarchist William Godwin, education was "the main means by which change would be achieved". Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness. For Godwin, education had to have a "respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion", a "pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives" and a "concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school". In his "[[Political Justice]]", he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government". Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established. Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called "[[The False Principle of our Education]]" in which Stirner names his educational principle "personalist", explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters", by which he means "eternal characters [...] who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".

In the United States, freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-Christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to "Liberty" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of "Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker". E.C. Walker was co-editor of "[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]" and many anarchists were "ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer", "Freethought" and "The Truth Seeker" appeared in "Liberty"... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. The schools' stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state. Murray Bookchin wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally". La Escuela Moderna and Ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of "[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]" in the United States, Cuba, South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper "[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]", founded in 1901. Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate. Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture. He thought that "[e]ducation is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself [...] Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary". For him, "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921. Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach. In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.


Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics.

Autism

Autism is a <a href="developmental%20disorder">developmental disorder</a> characterized by troubles with <a href="social%20interaction">social interaction</a> and <a href="communication">communication</a>, and by restricted and repetitive <a href="behavior">behavior</a>. Parents usually notice signs during the first two or three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their <a href="developmental%20milestones">developmental milestones</a> at a normal pace before <a href="Regressive%20autism">worsening</a>.
Autism is associated with a combination of <a href="Heritability%20of%20autism">genetic</a> and <a href="environmental%20factors">environmental factors</a>. Risk factors during pregancy include certain <a href="infection">infection</a>s such as <a href="rubella">rubella</a>, and certain toxins like <a href="valproic%20acid">valproic acid</a>, <a href="Alcohol%20%28drug%29">alcohol</a>, <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, <a href="pesticides">pesticides</a> and <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a>. <a href="Controversies%20in%20autism">Controversies</a> surround other proposed environmental <a href="Causes%20of%20autism">causes</a>; for example, the <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">vaccine hypotheses</a>, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the <a href="brain">brain</a> by altering how <a href="nerve%20cell">nerve cell</a>s and their <a href="synapse">synapse</a>s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>, autism and less severe forms of the condition, including <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> and <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder%20not%20otherwise%20specified">pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified</a> (PDD-NOS), have been combined into the diagnosis of <a href="autism%20spectrum%20disorder">autism spectrum disorder</a> (ASD).
<a href="Applied%20behavior%20analysis">Early behavioral interventions</a> and <a href="speech%20therapy">speech therapy</a> can help children with autism gain <a href="self-care">self-care</a>, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known <a href="cure">cure</a>, there have been cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some are successful. An <a href="Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism">autistic culture</a> has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be <a href="Autism%20rights%20movement">accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder</a>.
Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. In the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide. In the <a href="developed%20countries">developed countries</a>, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD , a more than doubling from 0.7% in 2000 in the United States. It occurs four-to-five times more often in boys than girls. The number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.

Autism is a highly variable <a href="neurodevelopmental%20disorder">neurodevelopmental disorder</a> that first appears during <a href="Infant">infancy</a> or <a href="childhood">childhood</a>, and generally follows a steady course without <a href="Remission%20%28medicine%29">remission</a>. People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.

Social deficits distinguish autism and the related <a href="autism%20spectrum%20disorder">autism spectrum disorder</a>s (ASD; see <a href="%23Classification">Classification</a>) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic <a href="Temple%20Grandin">Temple Grandin</a> described her inability to understand the <a href="social%20communication">social communication</a> of <a href="neurotypical">neurotypical</a>s, or people with normal <a href="neural%20development">neural development</a>, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from <a href="social%20norms">social norms</a>; for example, they have less <a href="eye%20contact">eye contact</a> and <a href="turn-taking">turn-taking</a>, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate <a href="nonverbal%20autism">nonverbal</a>ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form <a href="Attachment%20%28psychology%29">attachments</a> to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less <a href="Attachment%20in%20children%23Secure%20attachment">attachment security</a> than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD <a href="Face%20perception%23Face%20perception%20in%20individuals%20with%20autism">perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition</a> although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and <a href="tantrum">tantrum</a>s.

About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of <a href="babbling">babbling</a>, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (<a href="echolalia">echolalia</a>) or <a href="Pronoun%20reversal">reverse pronouns</a>. <a href="Joint%20attention">Joint attention</a> seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.

Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.


No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.

Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from <a href="splinter%20skill">splinter skill</a>s such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious <a href="Savant%20syndrome">autistic savants</a>. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. <a href="Sensory%20system">Sensory</a> abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include <a href="Hypotonia">poor muscle tone</a>, <a href="Apraxia">poor motor planning</a>, and <a href="toe%20walking">toe walking</a>; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.

Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a>. Although some children with autism also have <a href="gastrointestinal%20symptom">gastrointestinal symptom</a>s, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.

Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of <a href="stress%20%28psychological%29">stress</a>. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a> in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a>; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.

It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the <a href="Heritability%20of%20autism">genetics of autism</a> are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and <a href="epigenetic">epigenetic</a> factors which do not change <a href="DNA">DNA</a> sequencing but are heritable and influence <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.

Studies of twins suggest that <a href="heritability">heritability</a> is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a <a href="Mendelian">Mendelian</a> (single-gene) mutation or to a single <a href="chromosome%20abnormality">chromosome abnormality</a>, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous <a href="structural%20variation">structural variation</a> — such as <a href="Deletion%20%28genetics%29">deletions</a>, <a href="Gene%20duplication">duplications</a> or <a href="Chromosomal%20inversion">inversions</a> in genetic material during <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition.

Several lines of evidence point to <a href="Synapse">synaptic</a> dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with <a href="cell%20adhesion">cell adhesion</a>. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known <a href="teratogen">teratogen</a>s (agents that cause <a href="birth%20defect">birth defect</a>s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from <a href="Human%20fertilization">conception</a>, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.

Exposure to <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a> during pregnancy, especially <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. <a href="Environmental%20factor">Environmental factor</a>s that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>s, <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s, <a href="PCBs">PCBs</a>, <a href="phthalates">phthalates</a> and <a href="phenols">phenols</a> used in plastic products, <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, <a href="brominated%20flame%20retardant">brominated flame retardant</a>s, <a href="Ethanol">alcohol</a>, smoking, <a href="illicit%20drug">illicit drug</a>s, <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s, and <a href="prenatal%20stress">prenatal stress</a>. Some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven.

Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming <a href="Vaccine%20controversy%23Vaccine%20overload">vaccine "overload"</a>, a <a href="Thiomersal%20controversy">vaccine preservative</a>, or the <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">MMR vaccine</a> for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of <a href="childhood%20immunizations">childhood immunizations</a>, <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy%23Disease%20outbreaks">outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases</a> in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the <a href="pathophysiology">pathophysiology</a> of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the <a href="neuropsychological">neuropsychological</a> linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.

Unlike many other brain disorders, such as <a href="Parkinson%27s">Parkinson's</a>, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms. Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product. <a href="Neuroanatomical">Neuroanatomical</a> studies and the associations with <a href="teratogens">teratogens</a> strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors. Just after birth, the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism. It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization. Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following:

The <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> is thought to play an important role in autism. Children with autism have been found by researchers to have <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory <a href="cytokines">cytokines</a> and significant activation of <a href="microglia">microglia</a>. Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication. Interactions between the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> and the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> begin early during the <a href="Human%20embryogenesis">embryonic stage</a> of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is thought that activation of a pregnant mother's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development. This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism.

The relationship of <a href="neurochemical">neurochemical</a>s to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> and of genetic differences in its transport. The role of group I <a href="metabotropic%20glutamate%20receptors">metabotropic glutamate receptors</a> (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of <a href="fragile%20X%20syndrome">fragile X syndrome</a>, the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway. Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a>s or to impaired regulation of <a href="growth%20factor%20receptor">growth factor receptor</a>s. Also, some <a href="inborn%20errors%20of%20metabolism">inborn errors of metabolism</a> are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.

The <a href="mirror%20neuron%20system">mirror neuron system</a> (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions. Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD. However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.
ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the <a href="default%20network">default network</a> (a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing), with intact connectivity of the <a href="task-positive%20network">task-positive network</a> (used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking). In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of <a href="self-referential">self-referential</a> thought.

The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes. Evidence for this theory has been found in <a href="functional%20neuroimaging">functional neuroimaging</a> studies on autistic individuals and by a <a href="Electroencephalography">brainwave</a> study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the <a href="Cerebral%20cortex">cortex</a> and weak functional connections between the <a href="frontal%20lobe">frontal lobe</a> and the rest of the cortex. Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each <a href="Cerebral%20hemisphere">hemisphere</a> of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the <a href="Association%20areas">association cortex</a>.

From studies based on <a href="event-related%20potential">event-related potential</a>s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli. For example, <a href="magnetoencephalography">magnetoencephalography</a> studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.

In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with <a href="1q21.1%20deletion%20syndrome">1q21.1 deletion syndrome</a>. Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive.

Functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and hyper-connectivity in brains of people with autism. Hypo-connectivity seems to dominate, especially for interhemispheric and cortico-cortical functional connectivity.

Two major categories of <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a> theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in <a href="social%20cognition">social cognition</a>. <a href="Simon%20Baron-Cohen">Simon Baron-Cohen</a>'s <a href="empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing%20theory">empathizing–systemizing theory</a> postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing. These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier <a href="theory%20of%20mind">theory of mind</a> approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the <a href="Sally%E2%80%93Anne%20test">Sally–Anne test</a> for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in "<a href="%23Pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</a>" maps well to the hypothesis. However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the <a href="executive%20functions">executive functions</a> such as <a href="working%20memory">working memory</a>, planning, <a href="Inhibition%20Theory">inhibition</a>. In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of <a href="executive%20dysfunction">executive dysfunction</a> as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism". Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.

<a href="Weak%20central%20coherence%20theory">Weak central coherence theory</a> hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people. A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and <a href="perceptual">perceptual</a> operations in autistic individuals. Yet another, <a href="monotropism">monotropism</a>, posits that autism stems from a different cognitive style, tending to focus attention (or processing resources) intensely, to the exclusion of other stimuli. These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties. A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.

<a href="Medical%20diagnosis">Diagnosis</a> is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or <a href="Idiosyncrasy%23Psychiatry%20and%20psychology">idiosyncratic language</a>, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a>, <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or global developmental delay. <a href="ICD-10">ICD-10</a> uses essentially the same definition.

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the <a href="Autism%20Diagnostic%20Interview-Revised">Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised</a> (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the <a href="Autism%20Diagnostic%20Observation%20Schedule">Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</a> (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The <a href="Childhood%20Autism%20Rating%20Scale">Childhood Autism Rating Scale</a> (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.

A <a href="pediatrician">pediatrician</a> commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated <a href="medical%20conditions">medical conditions</a>. A pediatric <a href="neuropsychologist">neuropsychologist</a> is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> for ASD at this stage might also consider <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a>, <a href="hearing%20impairment">hearing impairment</a>, and a <a href="specific%20language%20impairment">specific language impairment</a> such as <a href="Landau%E2%80%93Kleffner%20syndrome">Landau–Kleffner syndrome</a>. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>.

<a href="Clinical%20genetics">Clinical genetics</a> evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and <a href="fragile%20X">fragile X</a> testing. A <a href="Genotype-first%20approach">genotype-first</a> model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. <a href="Metabolic">Metabolic</a> and <a href="neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a> tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Girls are often diagnosed later than boys.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the <a href="visually%20impaired">visually impaired</a>, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or <a href="blindism">blindism</a>s.

Autism is one of the five <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder">pervasive developmental disorder</a>s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.

Of the five PDD forms, <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a> and <a href="childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; <a href="PDD%20not%20otherwise%20specified">PDD not otherwise specified</a> (PDD-NOS; also called "atypical autism") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in <a href="language%20development">language development</a>. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) or sometimes the "autistic disorders", whereas autism itself is often called "autistic disorder", "childhood autism", or "infantile autism". In this article, "autism" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, "autism", "ASD", and "PDD" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like <a href="Trait%20%28biology%29">traits</a>, such as avoiding eye contact.

The manifestations of autism cover a wide <a href="Spectrum%20disorder">spectrum</a>, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, <a href="developmentally%20disabled">developmentally disabled</a>, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, <a href="pedantic">pedantic</a> communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or <a href="high-functioning%20autism">high-functioning autism</a> (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on <a href="IQ">IQ</a> thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into <a href="Syndrome">syndromal</a> and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as <a href="tuberous%20sclerosis">tuberous sclerosis</a>. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the <a href="Diagnosis%20of%20Asperger%20syndrome%23Differences%20from%20high-functioning%20autism">overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism</a> is unclear.

Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that <a href="regressive%20autism">regressive autism</a> is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.

Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of <a href="psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="neurology">neurology</a> and <a href="pediatrics">pediatrics</a>. Newer technologies such as <a href="fMRI">fMRI</a> and <a href="diffusion%20tensor%20imaging">diffusion tensor imaging</a> can help identify biologically relevant <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>s (observable traits) that can be viewed on <a href="brain%20scan">brain scan</a>s, to help further <a href="neurogenetic">neurogenetic</a> studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the <a href="fusiform%20face%20area">fusiform face area</a> of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.

About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".

The <a href="United%20States%20Preventive%20Services%20Task%20Force">United States Preventive Services Task Force</a> in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns. The Japanese practice is to <a href="Screening%20%28medicine%29">screen</a> all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the <a href="Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</a> (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on <a href="Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">M-CHAT</a> and its predecessor, the <a href="Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</a> (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low <a href="Sensitivity%20%28tests%29">sensitivity</a> (many false-negatives) but good <a href="Specificity%20%28tests%29">specificity</a> (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although <a href="genetic%20screening">genetic screening</a> for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and <a href="dysmorphic%20feature">dysmorphic feature</a>s.

While infection with <a href="rubella">rubella</a> during <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism, <a href="rubella%20vaccine">vaccination against rubella</a> can prevent many of those cases.

The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Services should be carried out by <a href="Professional%20practice%20of%20behavior%20analysis">behavior analysts</a>, <a href="special%20education">special education</a> <a href="teachers">teachers</a>, <a href="speech-language%20pathology">speech pathologists</a>, and licensed <a href="psychologists">psychologists</a>. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a>. However, the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many <a href="psychosocial">psychosocial</a> interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a>s of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained <a href="special%20education">special education</a> programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social communication, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability or hyperactivity.

Educational interventions often used include <a href="applied%20behavior%20analysis">applied behavior analysis</a> (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, <a href="speech%20and%20language%20therapy">speech and language therapy</a>, <a href="social%20skills">social skills</a> therapy, and <a href="occupational%20therapy">occupational therapy</a>. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)—over thirty hours per week of <a href="discrete%20trial%20training">discrete trial training</a> (DTT) for children younger than five—is currently low, and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include <a href="Discrete%20trial%20training">structured</a> and <a href="Pivotal%20response%20treatment">naturalistic</a> ABA interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.

<a href="Discrete%20trial%20training">Early, intensive ABA therapy</a> has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children, and is well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. Similarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more <a href="Pivotal%20response%20treatment">naturalistic form of ABA</a> combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.

Medications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. They may also be used for associated health problems such as <a href="ADHD">ADHD</a> or <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety</a>. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed <a href="psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive drug</a>s or <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a>s, with the most common drug classes being <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s, <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s, and <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a>s. The <a href="atypical%20antipsychotic">atypical antipsychotic</a> drugs <a href="risperidone">risperidone</a> and <a href="aripiprazole">aripiprazole</a> are <a href="Food%20and%20drug%20administration">FDA</a>-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.

Although many <a href="Alternative%20therapies%20for%20developmental%20and%20learning%20disabilities">alternative therapies and interventions</a> are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in <a href="Quality%20of%20life">quality-of-life</a> contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on <a href="casein-free%20diet">casein-free diet</a>s; in 2005, botched <a href="chelation%20therapy">chelation therapy</a> killed a five-year-old child with autism. Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is <a href="CEASE%20therapy">CEASE therapy</a>, a mixture of <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a>, supplements, and 'vaccine detoxing'.

Although popularly used as an <a href="complementary%20and%20alternative%20medicine">alternative treatment</a> for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a <a href="gluten-free%20diet">gluten-free diet</a> is of benefit. In the subset of people who have <a href="non-celiac%20gluten%20sensitivity">gluten sensitivity</a> there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors. There is tentative evidence that <a href="music%20therapy">music therapy</a> may improve social interactions, verbal communication, and non-verbal communication skills. There has been early research looking at <a href="Hyperbaric%20medicine">hyperbaric treatment</a>s in children with autism.

The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism. Through this movement, people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease. Proponents of this movement wish to seek "acceptance, not cures." There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as <a href="World%20Autism%20Awareness%20Day">World Autism Awareness Day</a>, <a href="Light%20It%20Up%20Blue">Light It Up Blue</a>, <a href="Autism%20Sunday">Autism Sunday</a>, <a href="Autistic%20Pride%20Day">Autistic Pride Day</a>, <a href="Autreat">Autreat</a>, and others. There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone's life. These organizations include <a href="Autism%20Speaks">Autism Speaks</a>, <a href="Autism%20National%20Committee">Autism National Committee</a>, <a href="Autism%20Society%20of%20America">Autism Society of America</a>, and many others. Social-science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about "autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons... and research on social movements." Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism. "<a href="Rain%20Man">Rain Man</a>", a film that won 4 Oscars including Best Picture, depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities. While many autistics don't have these special abilities, there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields.

Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ (<a href="net%20present%20value">net present value</a> in dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% <a href="medical%20care">medical care</a>, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that <a href="child%20care">child care</a> problems will greatly affect parental employment. US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance. After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and <a href="estate%20planning">estate planning</a>.

There is no known cure. Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Most children with autism lack <a href="social%20support">social support</a>, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or <a href="Self-determination%20theory">self-determination</a>. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.

Few high-quality studies address long-term <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a>. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an <a href="IQ">IQ</a> above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; <a href="independent%20living">independent living</a> is unlikely with severe autism. Most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood.

Most recent <a href="review">review</a>s tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true rate. Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people as of 2015, while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. In 2012, the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">NHS</a> estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of <a href="PDD-NOS">PDD-NOS</a>'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and <a href="childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC's most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children, or 14.7 per 1,000, has an ASD as of 2010.

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.

Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.

Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.

Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The "<a href="Table%20Talk%20%28Luther%29">Table Talk</a>" of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The <a href="Wild%20Boy%20of%20Aveyron">Wild Boy of Aveyron</a>, a <a href="feral%20child">feral child</a> caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student <a href="Jean%20Marc%20Gaspard%20Itard">Jean Itard</a> treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.

The <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> word "autismus" (English translation "autism") was coined by the <a href="Swiss%20people">Swiss</a> psychiatrist <a href="Eugen%20Bleuler">Eugen Bleuler</a> in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. He derived it from the Greek word "autós" (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".

The word "autism" first took its modern sense in 1938 when <a href="Hans%20Asperger">Hans Asperger</a> of the <a href="Vienna%20General%20Hospital">Vienna University Hospital</a> adopted Bleuler's terminology "autistic psychopaths" in a lecture in German about <a href="child%20psychology">child psychology</a>. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. <a href="Leo%20Kanner">Leo Kanner</a> of the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> first used "autism" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label "early infantile autism" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.

<a href="Donald%20Triplett">Donald Triplett</a> was the first person diagnosed with autism. He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as "case 1". Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords.

Kanner's reuse of "autism" led to decades of confused terminology like "infantile schizophrenia", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "<a href="refrigerator%20mother">refrigerator mother</a>s". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.

As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed, parents continue to feel <a href="social%20stigma">social stigma</a> in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many <a href="primary%20care%20physician">primary care physician</a>s and <a href="medical%20specialist">medical specialist</a>s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.

It took until 1980 for the <a href="DSM-III">DSM-III</a> to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the <a href="DSM-III-R">DSM-III-R</a> provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a> was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including <a href="PDD-NOS">PDD-NOS</a>, autism, <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a>, and <a href="Childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">CDD</a>, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. <a href="Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism">Societal and cultural aspects of autism</a> have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that <a href="Neurodiversity">autism is simply another way of being</a>.

Albedo

Albedo () (, meaning "whiteness") is the measure of the <a href="diffuse%20reflection">diffuse reflection</a> of <a href="sunlight">solar radiation</a> out of the total <a href="solar%20radiation">solar radiation</a> received by an <a href="astronomical%20body">astronomical body</a> (e.g. a <a href="planet">planet</a> like <a href="Earth">Earth</a>). It is <a href="dimensionless%20number">dimensionless</a> and measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a <a href="black%20body">black body</a> that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see <a href="position%20of%20the%20Sun">position of the Sun</a>). While bi-hemispherical <a href="reflectance">reflectance</a> is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation. Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible light</a> (0.39–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

Albedo is an important concept in <a href="climatology">climatology</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, and environmental management (e.g., as part of the <a href="Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its "planetary albedo", is 30–35% because of <a href="cloud%20cover">cloud cover</a>, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.

The term albedo was introduced into optics by <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Lambert">Johann Heinrich Lambert</a> in his 1760 work "<a href="Photometria">Photometria</a>".

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a <a href="black%20body">black body</a>. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of <a href="Earth">Earth</a> is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via <a href="Earth%20observation">Earth observation</a> satellite sensors such as <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="MODIS">MODIS</a> instruments on board the <a href="Terra%20%28satellite%29">Terra</a> and <a href="Aqua%20%28satellite%29">Aqua</a> satellites, and the CERES instrument on the <a href="Suomi%20NPP">Suomi NPP</a> and <a href="Joint%20Polar%20Satellite%20System">JPSS</a>. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of <a href="directional-hemispherical%20reflectance">directional-hemispherical reflectance</a> and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,). These calculations are based on the <a href="Bidirectional%20reflectance%20distribution%20function">bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)</a>, which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a> is currently about 15 °C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 °C. If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 °C. In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water — a so-called aquaplanet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 °C.

For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular <a href="solar%20zenith%20angle">solar zenith angle</a> "θ" can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, formula_1, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, formula_2, with formula_3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and formula_4 being the proportion of diffuse illumination.

Hence, the actual albedo formula_5 (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

<a href="Directional-hemispherical%20reflectance">Directional-hemispherical reflectance</a> is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and <a href="bi-hemispherical%20reflectance">bi-hemispherical reflectance</a> as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.

The albedos of <a href="planet">planet</a>s, <a href="Natural%20satellite">satellites</a> and <a href="minor%20planet">minor planet</a>s such as <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of <a href="photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometry</a>. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about <a href="regolith">regolith</a> properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s.

<a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a>, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is <a href="Eris%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Eris</a>, with an albedo of 0.96. Many small objects in the outer Solar System and <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a> have low albedos down to about 0.05. A typical <a href="comet%20nucleus">comet nucleus</a> has an albedo of 0.04. Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily <a href="space%20weathering">space weathered</a> surface containing some <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s.

The overall albedo of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> is measured to be around 0.136, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong <a href="opposition%20effect">opposition effect</a>. Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the <a href="regolith">regolith</a> surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) <a href="geometric%20albedo">geometric albedo</a> (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the <a href="Bond%20albedo">Bond albedo</a> (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five <a href="Hapke%20parameters">Hapke parameters</a> which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with <a href="phase%20angle%20%28astronomy%29">phase angle</a>, including a characterization of the opposition effect of <a href="regolith">regolith</a> surfaces.

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, <a href="Absolute%20magnitude%23Absolute%20magnitude%20for%20planets%20%28H%29">absolute magnitude</a> and diameter is:
formula_7,

where formula_8 is the astronomical albedo, formula_9 is the diameter in kilometers, and formula_10 is the absolute magnitude.

Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through albedo-temperature feedback). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.

The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local <a href="insolation">insolation</a> (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the <a href="arctic">arctic</a> and <a href="antarctic">antarctic</a> regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the <a href="Sahara%20Desert">Sahara Desert</a>, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. <a href="Tropical">Tropical</a> and <a href="sub-tropical">sub-tropical</a> <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their <a href="temperate%20forest">temperate forest</a> counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. This has been a concern since arctic ice and <a href="snow">snow</a> has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This <a href="Ice-albedo%20feedback">feedback loop</a> results in a reduced albedo effect.

Albedo affects <a href="climate">climate</a> by determining how much <a href="radiation">radiation</a> a planet absorbs. The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive <a href="weather">weather</a>.

When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature <a href="feedback">feedback</a> results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm <a href="air%20mass">air mass</a>), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local <a href="weather">weather</a> is dynamic due to the change of <a href="season">season</a>s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher <a href="insolation">insolation</a>) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. Over <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo <a href="positive%20feedback">positive feedback</a>).

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback. Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of <a href="Global%20warming">Global warming</a>.

<a href="Cryoconite">Cryoconite</a>, powdery windblown <a href="dust">dust</a> containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.

Albedo can affect the <a href="electrical%20energy">electrical energy</a> output of solar <a href="photovoltaic%20system">photovoltaic device</a>s. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%. More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.

Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a> is absorbed through <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect. Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through <a href="evapotranspiration">evapotranspiration</a>. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate 

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. <a href="Deciduous%20trees">Deciduous trees</a> have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas <a href="coniferous%20trees">coniferous trees</a> have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.

Studies by the <a href="Hadley%20Centre">Hadley Centre</a> have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of <a href="carbon%20sequestration">carbon sequestration</a> on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.

Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the <a href="Fresnel%20equations">Fresnel equations</a> (see graph).

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally <a href="specular%20reflection">specular manner</a> (not <a href="Diffuse%20reflection">diffusely</a>). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small <a href="angle%20of%20incidence%20%28optics%29">angles of incident</a> light, <a href="waviness">waviness</a> results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the <a href="terminator%20%28solar%29">terminator</a> (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.

<a href="Cloud%20albedo">Cloud albedo</a> has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the <a href="contrail">contrail</a>s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.

<a href="Aerosols">Aerosols</a> (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as <a href="cloud%20condensation%20nuclei">cloud condensation nuclei</a> and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain. As per the effects are:
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from <a href="black%20carbon">black carbon</a> particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the <a href="Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m. Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.

Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

<a href="Single-scattering%20albedo">Single-scattering albedo</a> is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material (<a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a>); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

A (<a href="English%20alphabet%23Letter%20names">named</a> , plural "As", "A's", "a"s, "a's" or "aes") is the first <a href="Letter%20%28alphabet%29">letter</a> and the first <a href="vowel">vowel</a> of the <a href="ISO%20basic%20Latin%20alphabet">ISO basic Latin alphabet</a>. It is similar to the <a href="Greek_alphabet%23History">Ancient Greek letter</a> <a href="alpha">alpha</a>, from which it derives. The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in <a href="italic%20type">italic type</a>.

The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is <a href="aleph">aleph</a> (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician alphabet</a>, which consisted entirely of <a href="consonant">consonant</a>s (for that reason, it is also called an <a href="abjad">abjad</a> to distinguish it from a true <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a <a href="pictogram">pictogram</a> of an ox head in <a href="proto-Sinaitic%20script">proto-Sinaitic script</a> influenced by <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a> or <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic</a> aleph.
When the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a> adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the <a href="glottal%20stop">glottal stop</a>—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician</a> and other <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic languages</a>, and that was the first <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of <a href="alpha">alpha</a>. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the <a href="Greek%20Dark%20Ages">Greek Dark Ages</a>, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscans</a> brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the <a href="Italian%20Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a> and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the <a href="Old%20Italic%20script">Etruscan alphabet</a> to write the <a href="Latin">Latin language</a>, and the resulting letter was preserved in the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin alphabet</a> that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.

During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" media. There was also a <a href="cursive">cursive</a> style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as <a href="letter%20case">majuscule</a> cursive, <a href="letter%20case">minuscule</a> cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early <a href="Uncial%20script%23Half-uncial">semi-uncial</a>, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.

At the end of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, the <a href="Merovingian%20script">Merovingian script</a> in France, the <a href="Visigothic%20script">Visigothic script</a> in Spain, and the <a href="Insular%20script">Insular</a> or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the <a href="Carolingian%20minuscule">Caroline script</a>, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the "Italic" and "Roman" forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called "script a," is used in most current <a href="handwriting">handwriting</a> and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter <a href="tau">tau</a> in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers. The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a"). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the <a href="serif">serif</a> that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

<a href="Italic%20type">Italic type</a> is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where "script a" ("ɑ"), also called <a href="Latin%20alpha">Latin alpha</a>, is used in contrast with Latin "a" (such as in the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>).

In modern <a href="English%20orthography">English orthography</a>, the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds:

The double sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as "Aaron" and "<a href="aardvark">aardvark</a>". However, occurs in <a href="List%20of%20Latin-script%20digraphs">many common digraphs</a>, all with their own sound or sounds, particularly , , , , and .

In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as , , or . An exception is <a href="Saanich%20dialect">Saanich</a>, in which (and the glyph <a href="%C3%81">Á</a>) stands for a <a href="close-mid%20front%20unrounded%20vowel">close-mid front unrounded vowel</a> .

In phonetic and phonemic notation:

In <a href="algebra">algebra</a>, the letter "a" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet ("x", "y", "z") are used to denote unknown quantities.

In <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote <a href="Line%20segment">segment</a>s, <a href="line%20%28geometry%29">line</a>s, <a href="Line%20%28geometry%29%23Ray">rays</a>, etc. A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a <a href="triangle">triangle</a>, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.

"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; <a href="A-list">A-list</a> celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a <a href="motivation">motivating</a> effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.

"A" is used as a prefix on some words, such as <a href="asymmetry">asymmetry</a>, to mean "not" or "without" (from Greek).

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a <a href="brassiere">brassiere</a>.

Alabama

Alabama is a <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a> in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southeastern region</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It is bordered by <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> to the north, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> to the east, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> to the south, and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> to the west. Alabama is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20area">30th largest by area</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20population">24th-most populous</a> of the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states">U.S. states</a>. With a total of of <a href="inland%20waterway">inland waterway</a>s, Alabama has among the most of any state.

Alabama is nicknamed the "<a href="Northern%20flicker">Yellowhammer</a> State", after the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20birds">state bird</a>. Alabama is also known as the "Heart of <a href="Dixie">Dixie</a>" and the "<a href="Cotton">Cotton</a> State". The <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20trees">state tree</a> is the <a href="longleaf%20pine">longleaf pine</a>, and the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20flowers">state flower</a> is the <a href="camellia">camellia</a>. Alabama's capital is <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>. The largest city by population is <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a>, which has long been the most industrialized city; the largest city by land area is <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville</a>. The oldest city is <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a>, founded by French <a href="colonists">colonists</a> in 1702 as the capital of <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">French Louisiana</a>.

From the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> until <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Alabama, like many states in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southern U.S.</a>, suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a> to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against African Americans from the end of the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a> up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, <a href="White%20American">white</a> rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.

The European-American naming of the <a href="Alabama%20River">Alabama River</a> and state was derived from the <a href="Alabama%20people">Alabama people</a>, a <a href="Muskogean%20languages">Muskogean-speaking tribe</a> whose members lived just below the confluence of the <a href="Coosa%20River">Coosa</a> and <a href="Tallapoosa%20River">Tallapoosa</a> rivers on the upper reaches of the river. In the <a href="Alabama%20language">Alabama language</a>, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is "Albaamo" (or variously "Albaama" or "Albàamo" in different dialects; the plural form is "Albaamaha"). The suggestion that "Alabama" was borrowed from the <a href="Choctaw%20language">Choctaw language</a> is unlikely. The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources. The first usage appears in three accounts of the <a href="Hernando%20de%20Soto">Hernando de Soto</a> expedition of 1540: <a href="Garcilaso%20de%20la%20Vega%20%28chronicler%29">Garcilaso de la Vega</a> used "Alibamo", while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote "Alibamu" and "Limamu", respectively, in <a href="transliteration">transliteration</a>s of the term. As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the "Alibamon", with French maps identifying the river as "Rivière des Alibamons". Other spellings of the name have included "Alibamu", "Alabamo", "Albama", "Alebamon", "Alibama", "Alibamou", "Alabamu", "Allibamou".

Sources disagree on the word's meaning. Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw "alba" (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and "amo" (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather"). The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket" or "herb gatherers", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants. The state has numerous <a href="List%20of%20place%20names%20in%20Alabama%20of%20Native%20American%20origin">place names of Native American origin</a>. However, there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama language.

An 1842 article in the "Jacksonville Republican" proposed it meant "Here We Rest." This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of <a href="Alexander%20Beaufort%20Meek">Alexander Beaufort Meek</a>. Experts in the <a href="Muskogean%20languages">Muskogean languages</a> have not found any evidence to support such a translation.

<a href="Indigenous%20peoples">Indigenous peoples</a> of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC–AD 700) and continued until <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">European contact</a>.

The agrarian <a href="Mississippian%20culture">Mississippian culture</a> covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the <a href="Moundville%20Archaeological%20Site">Moundville Archaeological Site</a> in <a href="Moundville%2C%20Alabama">Moundville, Alabama</a>. This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after <a href="Cahokia">Cahokia</a> in present-day <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, which was the center of the culture. Analysis of <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifacts</a> from <a href="archaeological">archaeological</a> excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the <a href="Southeastern%20Ceremonial%20Complex">Southeastern Ceremonial Complex</a> (SECC). Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.

Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, an <a href="Iroquoian%20language">Iroquoian language</a> people; and the <a href="Muskogean">Muskogean</a>-speaking <a href="Alabama%20%28people%29">Alabama</a> ("Alibamu"), <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>, <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, <a href="Creek%20people">Creek</a>, and <a href="Koasati">Koasati</a>. While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.

With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama. The expedition of <a href="Hernando%20de%20Soto">Hernando de Soto</a> passed through <a href="Mabila">Mabila</a> and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region's first European settlement at <a href="Old%20Mobile%20Site">Old Mobile</a> in 1702. The city was moved to the current site of <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of <a href="La%20Louisiane">La Louisiane</a>.

After the French lost to the British in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, it became part of British <a href="West%20Florida">West Florida</a> from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.

Thomas Bassett, a <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">loyalist</a> to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the <a href="Tombigbee%20District">Tombigbee District</a> during the early 1770s. The district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the <a href="Tombigbee%20River">Tombigbee River</a> and included portions of what is today southern <a href="Clarke%20County%2C%20Alabama">Clarke County</a>, northernmost <a href="Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama">Mobile County</a>, and most of <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Alabama">Washington County</a>.

What is now the counties of <a href="Baldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama">Baldwin</a> and <a href="Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> became part of <a href="Spanish%20West%20Florida">Spanish West Florida</a> in 1783, part of the independent <a href="Republic%20of%20West%20Florida">Republic of West Florida</a> in 1810, and was finally added to the <a href="Mississippi%20Territory">Mississippi Territory</a> in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the <a href="Yazoo%20lands">Yazoo lands</a> beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the <a href="Province%20of%20Georgia">Province of Georgia</a> from 1767 onwards. Following the <a href="American%20Revolution">Revolutionary War</a>, it remained a part of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, although heavily disputed.
With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the <a href="Yazoo%20land%20scandal">Yazoo land scandal</a>. Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a> officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.

Before <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi's</a> admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the <a href="Alabama%20Territory">Alabama Territory</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817. <a href="St.%20Stephens%2C%20Alabama">St. Stephens</a>, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.

Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819, with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to <a href="Cahaba%2C%20Alabama">Cahaba</a> in <a href="Dallas%20County%2C%20Alabama">Dallas County</a>.
Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825. <a href="Alabama%20Fever">Alabama Fever</a> was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation. Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.

Southeastern planters and traders from the <a href="Upper%20South">Upper South</a> brought <a href="History%20of%20slavery%20in%20Alabama">slaves</a> with them as the cotton <a href="List%20of%20plantations%20in%20Alabama">plantations in Alabama</a> expanded. The economy of the central <a href="Black%20Belt%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29">Black Belt</a> (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton <a href="Plantation%20complexes%20in%20the%20Southeastern%20United%20States">plantations</a> whose owners' wealth grew mainly from slave labor. The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became <a href="subsistence%20farmers">subsistence farmers</a>. Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830. Most Native American tribes were <a href="Indian%20removal">completely removed</a> from the state within a few years of the passage of the <a href="Indian%20Removal%20Act">Indian Removal Act</a> by Congress in 1830.
From 1826 to 1846, <a href="Tuscaloosa%2C%20Alabama">Tuscaloosa</a> served as Alabama's capital. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. A new capitol building was erected under the direction of <a href="Stephen%20Decatur%20Button">Stephen Decatur Button</a> of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of <a href="Exeter%2C%20Maine">Exeter, Maine</a>.

By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were <a href="free%20people%20of%20color">free people of color</a>. On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a> from the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a>. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>. The Confederacy's capital was initially at <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>. Alabama was heavily <a href="Alabama%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">involved in the American Civil War</a>. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.
A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama, joined <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>'s battalion in <a href="Hopkinsville%2C%20Kentucky">Hopkinsville, Kentucky</a>. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.

Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865. Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: <a href="Jeremiah%20Haralson">Jeremiah Haralson</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20S.%20Turner">Benjamin S. Turner</a>, and <a href="James%20T.%20Rapier">James T. Rapier</a>.

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>, state legislators ratified a <a href="Constitution%20of%20Alabama">new state constitution</a> in 1868 that created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation. Organized <a href="insurgent">insurgent</a>, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, these included the Pale Faces, <a href="Knights%20of%20the%20White%20Camellia">Knights of the White Camellia</a>, <a href="Red%20Shirts%20%28Southern%20United%20States%29">Red Shirts</a>, and the <a href="White%20League">White League</a>.

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the <a href="Blaine%20Amendment">Blaine Amendment</a>, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools. The same year, legislation was approved that called for <a href="racial%20segregation">racially segregated</a> schools. Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891. After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a> at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.

The new 1901 <a href="Constitution%20of%20Alabama">Constitution of Alabama</a> included provisions for voter registration that effectively <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20the%20Reconstruction%20Era">disenfranchised</a> large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a <a href="Poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll tax</a> and <a href="literacy%20test">literacy test</a>. The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were <a href="literate">literate</a>. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades. The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.

While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax. By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans. Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes. Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the <a href="Rosenwald%20Fund">Rosenwald Fund</a> began funding the construction of what came to be known as <a href="Rosenwald%20School">Rosenwald School</a>s. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.
Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African-American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. Several of the <a href="The%20Rosenwald%20School%20Building%20Fund%20and%20Associated%20Buildings%20Multiple%20Property%20Submission">surviving school buildings</a> in the state are now listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

Continued racial discrimination and <a href="lynching">lynching</a>s, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to <a href="boll%20weevil">boll weevil</a> infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a> out of the South. Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see "historical populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.

At the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a> to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the "Magic City". By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.

Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a>. The legislature also changed the boundaries of <a href="Tuskegee%2C%20Alabama">Tuskegee</a> to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial "<a href="gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>" violated the Constitution. In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war. Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries. Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Alabama">Jefferson County</a>, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."

In the United States Supreme Court cases of "<a href="Baker%20v.%20Carr">Baker v. Carr</a>" (1962) and "<a href="Reynolds%20v.%20Sims">Reynolds v. Sims</a>" (1964), the court ruled ruled that the principle of "<a href="one%20man%2C%20one%20vote">one man, one vote</a>" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as Alabama had used for its senate.

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years. Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>, including legal challenges. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>" that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for <a href="desegregation">desegregation</a>. The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the <a href="Montgomery%20Bus%20Boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a> (1955–56), <a href="Freedom%20Rides">Freedom Rides</a> in 1961, and 1965 <a href="Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches">Selma to Montgomery marches</a>. These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and <a href="Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> by the U.S. Congress.

Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a> customs often continued until specifically challenged in court. According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", by 2017, many of Alabama's African-Americans were living in Alabama's "cities, particularly Birmingham and Montgomery. In addition, the rural Black Belt (called that for its soil) that stretches across the middle of the state is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include <a href="Dallas%20County%2C%20Alabama">Dallas</a>, <a href="Lowndes%20County%2C%20Alabama">Lowndes</a>, <a href="Marengo%20County%2C%20Alabama">Marengo</a> and <a href="Perry%20County%2C%20Alabama">Perry</a>."

Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, "<a href="Dillard%20v.%20Crenshaw%20County">Dillard v. Crenshaw County</a>", challenged the <a href="at-large">at-large</a> voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including <a href="Chilton%20County%2C%20Alabama">Chilton County</a>, adopted a system of <a href="proportional%20representation">cumulative voting</a> for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in <a href="Conecuh%20County%2C%20Alabama">Conecuh County</a>. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in <a href="Conecuh%20County%2C%20Alabama">Conecuh County</a>. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.

Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States. About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. The <a href="North%20Alabama">North Alabama</a> region is mostly mountainous, with the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a> cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.

Alabama is bordered by the states of <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> to the north, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> to the east, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to the south, and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state. The state ranges in elevation from sea level at <a href="Mobile%20Bay">Mobile Bay</a> to over 1,800 feet (550 m) in the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> in the northeast.

The highest point is <a href="Mount%20Cheaha">Mount Cheaha</a>, at a height of . Alabama's land consists of of forest or 67% of total land area. Suburban <a href="Baldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama">Baldwin County</a>, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.

A notable natural wonder in Alabama is <a href="Natural%20Bridge%2C%20Alabama">"Natural Bridge"</a> rock, the longest <a href="natural%20bridge">natural bridge</a> east of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a>, located just south of <a href="Haleyville%2C%20Alabama">Haleyville</a>.

A -wide meteorite impact crater is located in <a href="Elmore%20County%2C%20Alabama">Elmore County</a>, just north of Montgomery. This is the <a href="Wetumpka%20crater">Wetumpka crater</a>, the site of "Alabama's greatest natural disaster." A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown <a href="Wetumpka">Wetumpka</a> showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface. In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.

The state is classified as <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical</a> ("Cfa") under the <a href="Humid%20temperate%20climate">Koppen Climate Classification</a>. The average annual temperature is 64 °F (18 °C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler. Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a>s and even <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a>s. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent <a href="lightning">lightning</a> and large <a href="hail">hail</a>; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.
Alabama, along with <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, has the most reported <a href="Enhanced%20Fujita%20scale">EF5 tornadoes</a> of any state, according to statistics from the <a href="National%20Climatic%20Data%20Center">National Climatic Data Center</a> for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013. Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state. The state was affected by the <a href="1974%20Super%20Outbreak">1974 Super Outbreak</a> and was devastated tremendously by the <a href="2011%20Super%20Outbreak">2011 Super Outbreak</a>. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.
The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as <a href="Dixie%20Alley">Dixie Alley</a>, as distinct from the <a href="Tornado%20Alley">Tornado Alley</a> of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the <a href="Southeastern%20United%20States">Southeastern United States</a>, with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve%201963%20snowstorm">New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm</a> and the <a href="1993%20Storm%20of%20the%20Century">1993 Storm of the Century</a>. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of <a href="Centerville%2C%20Alabama">Centerville</a>. The record low of occurred on January 30, 1966, in <a href="New%20Market%2C%20Alabama">New Market</a>.

Alabama is home to a diverse array of <a href="flora">flora</a> and <a href="fauna">fauna</a>, due largely to a variety of habitats that range from the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley">Tennessee Valley</a>, <a href="Appalachian%20Plateau">Appalachian Plateau</a>, and <a href="Ridge-and-Valley%20Appalachians">Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians</a> of the north to the <a href="Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29">Piedmont</a>, <a href="Canebrake%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29">Canebrake</a> and <a href="Black%20Belt%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29">Black Belt</a> of the central region to the <a href="Gulf%20Coastal%20Plain">Gulf Coastal Plain</a> and beaches along the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.

Alabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state. It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 <a href="pteridophyte">pteridophyte</a> and <a href="spermatophyte">spermatophyte</a> plant species.

<a href="Indigenous%20%28ecology%29">Indigenous</a> animal species in the state include 62 <a href="mammal">mammal</a> <a href="species">species</a>, 93 reptile species, 73 <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a> species, roughly 307 native <a href="freshwater%20fish">freshwater fish</a> species, and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state. Invertebrates include 97 <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> species and 383 <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a> species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.

The <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> estimates that the population of Alabama was 4,858,979 on July 1, 2015, which represents an increase of 79,243, or 1.66%, since the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 Census</a>. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state.

<a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">Immigration</a> from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people. The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000).

The <a href="center%20of%20population">center of population</a> of Alabama is located in <a href="Chilton%20County%2C%20Alabama">Chilton County</a>, outside the town of <a href="Jemison%2C%20Alabama">Jemison</a>.

According to the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 Census</a>, Alabama had a population of 4,779,736. The racial composition of the state was 68.5% <a href="White%20American">White</a> (67.0% <a href="Non-Hispanic%20White">Non-Hispanic White</a> and 1.5% <a href="Hispanic%20White">Hispanic White</a>), 26.2% <a href="African%20American">Black or African American</a>, 3.9% <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic or Latino</a> of any race, 1.1% Asian, 0.6% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indian and Alaska Native</a>, 0.1% <a href="Native%20Hawaiians">Native Hawaiian</a> and Other <a href="Pacific%20Islander">Pacific Islander</a>, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races. In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama's population younger than age 1 were minorities.

The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: <a href="African%20American">African</a> (26.2%), <a href="English%20American">English</a> (23.6%), <a href="Irish%20American">Irish</a> (7.7%), <a href="German%20Americans">German</a> (5.7%), and <a href="Scots-Irish%20American">Scots-Irish</a> (2.0%). Those citing "American" ancestry in Alabama are generally of English or British ancestry; many <a href="English%20American">Anglo-Americans</a> identify as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and that the figure is likely higher. In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama identified as being of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time.

Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported. Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization. The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.

In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the <a href="Alabama%20Indian%20Affairs%20Commission">Alabama Indian Affairs Commission</a>. Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.

The state has <a href="State%20recognized%20tribes%20in%20the%20United%20States">officially recognized</a> nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the <a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> of the American Southeast. These are:

The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.

95.1% of all Alabama residents five years old or older spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern</a>, and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of 'bird'. In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland 'arm' and 'barb' rhyming with 'form' and 'orb'. Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (clingstone), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons).

In the 2008 <a href="American%20Religious%20Identification%20Survey">American Religious Identification Survey</a>, 86% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian, including 6% Catholic, with 11% as having no religion. The composition of other traditions is 0.5% Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu.

Alabama is located in the middle of the <a href="Bible%20Belt">Bible Belt</a>, a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly. A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. , the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a>, <a href="The%20United%20Methodist%20Church">The United Methodist Church</a>, and <a href="Nondenominational%20Christianity">non-denominational</a> Evangelical Protestant.

In Alabama, the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a> with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the <a href="Great%20Awakening">Great Awakening</a> of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The <a href="Assemblies%20of%20God">Assemblies of God</a> had almost 60,000 members, the <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Churches of Christ</a> had nearly 120,000 members. The <a href="Presbyterian%20church">Presbyterian church</a>es, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (<a href="Presbyterian%20Church%20in%20America">PCA</a> – 28,009 members in 108 congregations, <a href="PC%28USA%29">PC(USA)</a> – 26,247 members in 147 congregations, the <a href="Cumberland%20Presbyterian%20Church">Cumberland Presbyterian Church</a> – 6,000 members in 59 congregations, the <a href="Cumberland%20Presbyterian%20Church%20in%20America">Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America</a> – 5,000 members and 50 congregations plus the <a href="Edgewater%20Presbyterian%20Church">EPC</a> and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations).

In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian <a href="Canonical%20Gospels">Gospels</a>. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a "full understanding" of their faith and needed no further learning. In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.

Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a>, and <a href="Unitarian%20Universalism">Unitarian Universalism</a>.

Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when <a href="Sephardic%20Jews">Sephardic Jews</a> immigrated from London. The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is <a href="Congregation%20Sha%27arai%20Shomayim%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29">Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim</a> in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844. Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a> from eastern Europe. Jewish denominations in the state include two <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a>, four <a href="Conservative%20Judaism">Conservative</a>, ten <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a>, and one <a href="Humanistic%20Judaism">Humanistic</a> synagogue.

Muslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.

Several Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by <a href="Indian%20people">Indian</a> immigrants and their descendants, the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a>, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in <a href="Pelham%2C%20Alabama">Pelham</a>, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in <a href="Capshaw%2C%20Alabama">Capshaw</a>, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in <a href="Tuscaloosa%2C%20Alabama">Tuscaloosa</a>.

There are six <a href="Dharma%20centre">Dharma centers</a> and organizations for <a href="Theravada">Theravada</a> <a href="Buddhists">Buddhists</a>. Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near <a href="Bayou%20La%20Batre%2C%20Alabama">Bayou La Batre</a>. This area has attracted an <a href="Indochina%20refugee%20crisis">influx of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam</a> during the 1970s and thereafter. The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.

The first community of adherents of the <a href="Baha%27i%20Faith">Baha'i Faith</a> in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy, who moved from Chicago to <a href="Fairhope">Fairhope</a>. Baha'i Centers in Alabama exist in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>, <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville, Alabama</a>, and <a href="Florence%2C%20Alabama">Florence, Alabama</a>.

A <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama was a problem, with most counties having over 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%. Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time. Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset <a href="diabetes%20type%20II">diabetes</a> in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.

The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and <a href="fabrication%20%28metal%29">fabrication</a>. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.

Non-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.

According to the U.S. <a href="Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, the 2008 total <a href="gross%20state%20product">gross state product</a> was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama's 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information. In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.8% in April 2015. This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 5.4%.

Alabama has no state minimum wage and uses the federal minimum wage of $7.25. In February 2016, the state passed legislation that prevents Alabama municipalities from raising the minimum wage in their locality. The legislation voids a Birmingham city ordinance that was to raise the city's minimum wage to $10.10.

As of 2018, Alabama has the sixth highest poverty rate among states in the U.S. In 2017, United Nations Special Rapporteur <a href="Philip%20Alston">Philip Alston</a> toured parts of rural Alabama and observed environmental conditions that he said were poorer than anywhere he had seen in the developed world.

The five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 were:

The next twenty largest employers, , included:
Alabama's agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, fish, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as <a href="Corn%20production%20in%20the%20United%20States">corn</a> and <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, vegetables, milk, <a href="soybean">soybean</a>s, and peaches. Although known as "<a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20nicknames">The Cotton State</a>", Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in <a href="Cotton%20production%20in%20the%20United%20States">national cotton production</a>, according to various reports, with <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> comprising the top three.

Alabama's industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, <a href="lumber">lumber</a>, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and <a href="apparel">apparel</a>. In addition, Alabama produces <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> and <a href="electronics">electronic</a> products, mostly in the <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville</a> area, the location of <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="George%20C.%20Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">George C. Marshall Space Flight Center</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Materiel%20Command">U.S. Army Materiel Command</a>, headquartered at <a href="Redstone%20Arsenal">Redstone Arsenal</a>.
A great deal of Alabama's economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state's expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are <a href="Honda%20Manufacturing%20of%20Alabama">Honda Manufacturing of Alabama</a>, <a href="Hyundai%20Motor%20Manufacturing%20Alabama">Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama</a>, <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20U.S.%20International">Mercedes-Benz U.S. International</a>, and <a href="Toyota%20Motor%20Manufacturing%20Alabama">Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama</a>, as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.

Automakers accounted for approximately a third of the industrial expansion in the state in 2012. The eight models produced at the state's auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012. The strongest model sales during this period were the <a href="Hyundai%20Elantra">Hyundai Elantra</a> compact car, the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20GL-Class">Mercedes-Benz GL-Class</a> sport utility vehicle and the <a href="Honda%20Ridgeline">Honda Ridgeline</a> sport utility truck.
Steel producers <a href="Outokumpu">Outokumpu</a>, <a href="Nucor">Nucor</a>, <a href="SSAB">SSAB</a>, <a href="ThyssenKrupp">ThyssenKrupp</a>, and <a href="U.S.%20Steel">U.S. Steel</a> have facilities in Alabama and employ over 10,000 people. In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected <a href="Calvert%2C%20Alabama">Calvert</a> in <a href="Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama">Mobile County</a> for a 4.65 billion combined <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless</a> and <a href="carbon%20steel">carbon steel</a> processing facility. ThyssenKrupp's stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012. The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by <a href="ArcelorMittal">ArcelorMittal</a> and <a href="Nippon%20Steel">Nippon Steel</a> for $1.6 billion in March 2013. <a href="Companhia%20Sider%C3%BArgica%20Nacional">Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional</a> submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3.8 billion. In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.

The <a href="Hunt%20Refining%20Company">Hunt Refining Company</a>, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there.

Construction of an <a href="Airbus%20A320%20family">Airbus A320 family</a> aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> CEO <a href="Fabrice%20Br%C3%A9gier">Fabrice Brégier</a> from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the <a href="Brookley%20Aeroplex">Brookley Aeroplex</a> for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. Construction began in 2013, with plans for it to become operable by 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017. The assembly plant is the company's first factory to be built within the United States. It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based <a href="Hoar%20Construction">Hoar Construction</a> to oversee construction of the facility.

An estimated 20 million tourists visit the state each year. Over 100,000 of these are from other countries, including from Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. In 2006, 22.3 million travellers spent $8.3 billion providing an estimated 162,000 jobs in the state. Some of the most popular areas include the Rocket City of Huntsville, the beaches along the Gulf, and the state's capitol in Montgomery.

<a href="UAB%20Hospital">UAB Hospital</a> is the only <a href="trauma%20center">Level I trauma center</a> in Alabama. UAB is the largest state government employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 18,000.

Alabama has the headquarters of <a href="Regions%20Financial%20Corporation">Regions Financial Corporation</a>, <a href="BBVA%20Compass">BBVA Compass</a>, <a href="Superior%20Bancorp">Superior Bancorp</a> and the former <a href="Colonial%20Bancgroup">Colonial Bancgroup</a>. Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Spanish-based <a href="BBVA">BBVA</a> in September 2007, although the headquarters of BBVA Compass remains in Birmingham. In November 2006, Regions Financial completed its merger with <a href="AmSouth%20Bancorporation">AmSouth Bancorporation</a>, which was also headquartered in Birmingham. <a href="SouthTrust%20Corporation">SouthTrust Corporation</a>, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by <a href="Wachovia">Wachovia</a> in 2004 for $14.3 billion.

The city still has major operations for Wachovia and its now post-operating bank <a href="Wells%20Fargo">Wells Fargo</a>, which includes a regional headquarters, an operations center campus and a $400 million data center. Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham, such as Superior Bancorp, <a href="ServisFirst">ServisFirst</a> and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including <a href="Harbert%20Management%20Corporation">Harbert Management Corporation</a>.

Rust International has grown to include <a href="Brasfield%20%26amp%3B%20Gorrie">Brasfield & Gorrie</a>, <a href="BE%26amp%3BK">BE&K</a>, <a href="Hoar%20Construction">Hoar Construction</a> and <a href="B.L.%20Harbert%20International">B.L. Harbert International</a>, which all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms. (Rust International was acquired in 2000 by <a href="Washington%20Group%20International">Washington Group International</a>, which was in turn acquired by San-Francisco based <a href="URS%20Corporation">URS Corporation</a> in 2007.)

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the <a href="Alabama%20Constitution">Alabama Constitution</a>, which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution. Critics argue that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.

Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The <a href="legislative%20branch">legislative branch</a> is the <a href="Alabama%20Legislature">Alabama Legislature</a>, a <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a> assembly composed of the <a href="Alabama%20House%20of%20Representatives">Alabama House of Representatives</a>, with 105 members, and the <a href="Alabama%20Senate">Alabama Senate</a>, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> currently holds a majority in both houses of the <a href="Alabama%20Legislature">Legislature</a>. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In "<a href="Reynolds%20v.%20Sims">Reynolds v. Sims</a>" (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of "<a href="one%20man%2C%20one%20vote">one man, one vote</a>", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.
The <a href="executive%20branch">executive branch</a> is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the <a href="Governor%20of%20Alabama">Governor of Alabama</a>. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Alabama">Attorney General of Alabama</a>, the <a href="Alabama%20Secretary%20of%20State">Alabama Secretary of State</a>, the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Treasurer">Alabama State Treasurer</a>, and the <a href="State%20Auditor%20of%20Alabama">State Auditor of Alabama</a>. The current <a href="Governor%20of%20Alabama">governor</a> of the state is <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Kay%20Ivey">Kay Ivey</a>. The office of <a href="List%20of%20Lieutenant%20Governors%20of%20Alabama">lieutenant governor</a> is currently vacant.

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.

The <a href="Judiciary">judicial branch</a> is responsible for interpreting the <a href="Alabama%20Constitution">Constitution</a> and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The <a href="State%20supreme%20court">state's highest court</a> is the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Alabama">Supreme Court of Alabama</a>. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized. The current <a href="chief%20justice">chief justice</a> of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican <a href="Lyn%20Stuart">Lyn Stuart</a>. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate <a href="appellate%20court">appellate court</a>s, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four <a href="trial%20court">trial court</a>s: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.

Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions. Alabama has the highest per capita <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20Alabama">death penalty rate</a> in the country. In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, a state which has a population five times larger. Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the Supreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases. It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of <a href="life%20imprisonment%20without%20parole">life imprisonment without parole</a> (LWOP) that were voted unanimously by juries. This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.

Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent <a href="State%20income%20tax">personal income tax</a>, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their <a href="Income%20tax%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal income tax</a> from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the <a href="standard%20deduction">standard deduction</a>. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the <a href="Federal%20Insurance%20Contributions%20Act%20tax">Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax</a> (Social Security and Medicare tax).

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%. Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal. , sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families. (Most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)

Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the United States. Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line. Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country. <a href="Property%20tax">Property tax</a>es are the lowest in the U.S. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.

Alabama has 67 <a href="county%20%28United%20States%29">counties</a>. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the <a href="Alabama%20Constitution">Alabama Constitution</a>, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited <a href="home%20rule">home rule</a>. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing <a href="home%20rule">home rule</a> for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission. Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in "<a href="Baker%20v.%20Carr">Baker v. Carr</a>" (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of "one man, one vote". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance."

Alabama is an <a href="alcoholic%20beverage%20control%20state">alcoholic beverage control state</a>, meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The <a href="Alabama%20Alcoholic%20Beverage%20Control%20Board">Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board</a> controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. Twenty-five of the 67 counties are "<a href="Dry%20county">dry counties</a>" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.

During <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> following the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the <a href="Third%20Military%20District">Third Military District</a> under <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">General John Pope</a>. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the <a href="Redeemers">Redeemers</a> took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.

After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to <a href="racial%20segregation">segregate</a> and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and <a href="Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by <a href="at-large">at-large</a> electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish <a href="single-member%20districts">single-member districts</a> that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

In 2007, the <a href="Alabama%20Legislature">Alabama Legislature</a> passed, and Republican Governor <a href="Bob%20Riley">Bob Riley</a> signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Capitol">Alabama State Capitol</a>, which housed Congress of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>.

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years, after a nearly complete realignment of political parties, who represent different visions in the 21st century.

As of December 2017, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.

With the <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disfranchisement of Blacks</a> in 1901, the state became part of the "<a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>", a system in which the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party <a href="primary%20election">primary</a>, with generally only token <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Alabama">Supreme Court of Alabama</a> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice, <a href="Ernest%20C.%20Hornsby">Ernest C. Hornsby</a>, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican <a href="Perry%20O.%20Hooper%2C%20Sr.">Perry O. Hooper, Sr.</a>. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the <a href="Political%20party%20strength%20in%20Alabama">statewide elected executive</a> branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Board%20of%20Education">Alabama State Board of Education</a>. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.

Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated <a href="Freedman">freedmen</a> who had gained the franchise. The two GOP Lt. Governors were Steve Windom (1999–2003) and <a href="Kay%20Ivey">Kay Ivey</a> (2011-2017).

Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.

Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan, <a href="at-large">at-large</a> races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. The current split is 35 <a href="Alabama%20Democratic%20Party">Democrats</a>, 31 <a href="Alabama%20Republican%20Party">Republicans</a>, and one Independent Fayette. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. , the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in <a href="Morgan%20County%2C%20Alabama">Morgan County, Alabama</a>, and ten African-American sheriffs.

The state's two <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. senators</a> are Republican <a href="Richard%20Shelby">Richard C. Shelby</a> and Democrat <a href="Doug%20Jones%20%28politician%29">Doug Jones</a>. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.

In the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (<a href="Bradley%20Byrne">Bradley Byrne</a>, <a href="Mike%20D.%20Rogers">Mike D. Rogers</a>, <a href="Robert%20Aderholt">Robert Aderholt</a>, <a href="Morris%20J.%20Brooks">Morris J. Brooks</a>, <a href="Martha%20Roby">Martha Roby</a>, and <a href="Gary%20Palmer%20%28politician%29">Gary Palmer</a>) and one Democrat: <a href="Terri%20Sewell">Terri Sewell</a> who represents the <a href="Black%20Belt%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29">Black Belt</a> as well as most of the predominantly black portions of <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a>, <a href="Tuscaloosa%2C%20Alabama">Tuscaloosa</a> and <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>.
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Board%20of%20Education">Alabama State Board of Education</a> as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National <a href="No%20Child%20Left%20Behind">No Child Left Behind</a> law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate—75%—is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>). The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.

Although unusual in the West, <a href="school%20corporal%20punishment">school corporal punishment</a> is not uncommon in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students <a href="paddle%20%28spanking%29">paddled</a> at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed only by Mississippi and Arkansas.

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) (<a href="University%20of%20Alabama%20School%20of%20Medicine">University of Alabama School of Medicine</a>, <a href="University%20of%20South%20Alabama">University of South Alabama</a> and <a href="Alabama%20College%20of%20Osteopathic%20Medicine">Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine – Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (<a href="Auburn%20University">Auburn University</a> and <a href="Tuskegee%20University">Tuskegee University</a>), a dental school (<a href="University%20of%20Alabama%20School%20of%20Dentistry">University of Alabama School of Dentistry</a>), an optometry college (<a href="University%20of%20Alabama%20at%20Birmingham">University of Alabama at Birmingham</a>), two pharmacy schools (<a href="Auburn%20University">Auburn University</a> and <a href="Samford%20University">Samford University</a>), and five law schools (<a href="University%20of%20Alabama%20School%20of%20Law">University of Alabama School of Law</a>, <a href="Birmingham%20School%20of%20Law">Birmingham School of Law</a>, <a href="Cumberland%20School%20of%20Law">Cumberland School of Law</a>, <a href="Miles%20Law%20School">Miles Law School</a>, and the <a href="Thomas%20Goode%20Jones%20School%20of%20Law">Thomas Goode Jones School of Law</a>). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the <a href="Alabama%20Commission%20on%20Higher%20Education">Alabama Commission on Higher Education</a> and the <a href="Alabama%20Department%20of%20Postsecondary%20Education">Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education</a>.

Achilles

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Achilles or Achilleus ( ; , "Achilleus" ) was a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> hero of the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a> and the central character and greatest warrior of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". His mother was the immortal <a href="Nereid">Nereid</a> <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a>, and his father, the mortal <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a>, was the king of the <a href="Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>.

Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero <a href="Hector">Hector</a> outside the gates of <a href="Troy">Troy</a>. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the "Iliad", other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a>, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by <a href="Statius">Statius</a> in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because, when his mother <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a> dipped him in the river <a href="Styx">Styx</a> as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term "<a href="Achilles%27%20heel">Achilles' heel</a>" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution.

<a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> tablets attest to the personal name "Achilleus" in the forms "a-ki-re-u" and "a-ki-re-we", the latter being the <a href="dative%20case">dative</a> of the former. The name grew more popular, even becoming common soon after the seventh century BC and was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία ("Achilleía"), attested in <a href="Attica">Attica</a> in the fourth century BC (<a href="Inscriptiones%20Graecae">IG</a> II² 1617) and, in the form "Achillia", on a <a href="Female%20gladiator%23Halicarnassus">stele in Halicarnassus</a> as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".

Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of (') "distress, pain, sorrow, grief" and (') "people, soldiers, nation", resulting in a proto-form "*Akhí-lāu̯os" "he who has the people distressed" or "he whose people have distress". The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the "Iliad" (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of "" ("glory", usually in war). Furthermore, "laós" has been construed by <a href="Gregory%20Nagy">Gregory Nagy</a>, following <a href="Leonard%20Palmer">Leonard Palmer</a>, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a <a href="muster%20%28military%29">muster</a>. With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

Another etymology relates the name to a <a href="Proto-Indo-European">Proto-Indo-European</a> <a href="Compound%20%28linguistics%29">compound</a> "*h₂eḱ-pṓds" "sharp foot" which first gave an <a href="Illyrian%20languages">Illyrian</a> "*āk̂pediós", evolving through time into "*ākhpdeós" and then "*akhiddeús". The shift from "-dd-" to "-ll-" is then ascribed to the passing of the name into Greek via a <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> source. The first root part "*h₂eḱ-" "sharp, pointed" also gave Greek ἀκή ("akḗ" "point, silence, healing"), ἀκμή ("akmḗ" "point, edge, zenith") and ὀξύς ("oxús" "sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever"), whereas ἄχος stems from the root "*h₂egʰ-" "to be upset, afraid". The whole expression would be comparable to the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "acupedius" "swift of foot". Compare also the Latin word family of "aciēs" "sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement", "acus" "needle, pin, bodkin", and "acuō" "to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse" (whence "acute"). Some <a href="Literary%20topos">topical</a> <a href="epitheta">epitheta</a> of Achilles in the "Iliad" point to this "swift-footedness", namely ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεὺς ("podárkēs dĩos Achilleús" "swift-footed divine Achilles") or, even more frequently, πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς ("pódas ōkús Achilleús" "quick-footed Achilles").

Some researchers deem the name a <a href="loan%20word">loan word</a>, possibly from a <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> language. Achilles' descent from the <a href="Nereid">Nereid</a> <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a> and a similarity of his name with those of <a href="Potamoi">river deities</a> such as <a href="Acheron">Acheron</a> and <a href="Achelous">Achelous</a> have led to speculations about him being an old <a href="Greek%20sea%20gods">water divinity</a> (see below <a href="Achilles%23Worship">Worship</a>). <a href="Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes">Robert S. P. Beekes</a> has suggested a <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of "-λλ-" and "-λ-" in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /l/ in the original language.

Achilles was the son of the <a href="Nereid">Nereid</a> <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a> and of <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a>, the king of the <a href="Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>. <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by <a href="Themis">Themis</a>, goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the "<a href="Argonautica">Argonautica</a>" (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife <a href="Hera">Hera</a> alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god <a href="Nereus">Nereus</a>, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.

According to the "<a href="Achilleid">Achilleid</a>", written by <a href="Statius">Statius</a> in the 1st century AD, and to <a href="Lost%20works">non-surviving previous sources</a>, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river <a href="Styx">Styx</a>. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel (see <a href="Achilles%27%20heel">Achilles' heel</a>, <a href="Achilles%27%20tendon">Achilles' tendon</a>). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in <a href="ambrosia">ambrosia</a> and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.

However, none of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the "Iliad" Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the <a href="Paeonian">Paeonian</a> hero <a href="Asteropaeus">Asteropaeus</a>, son of <a href="Pelagon">Pelagon</a>, challenged Achilles by the river <a href="Scamander">Scamander</a>. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood".

Also, in the fragmentary poems of the <a href="Epic%20Cycle">Epic Cycle</a> in which one can find description of the hero's death (i.e. the "<a href="Cypria">Cypria</a>", the "<a href="Little%20Iliad">Little Iliad</a>" by <a href="Lesches">Lesches</a> of Pyrrha, the "<a href="Aithiopis">Aithiopis</a>" and "<a href="Iliou%20persis">Iliou persis</a>" by <a href="Arctinus%20of%20Miletus">Arctinus of Miletus</a>), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel; in the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body. Peleus entrusted Achilles to <a href="Chiron">Chiron</a> the <a href="Centaur">Centaur</a>, on <a href="Mount%20Pelion">Mount Pelion</a>, to be reared. Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan war. According to Homer, Achilles grew up in Phthia together with his companion <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>.

According to <a href="Photius">Photius</a>, the sixth book of the "New History" by <a href="Ptolemy%20Hephaestion">Ptolemy Hephaestion</a> reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; but when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron. Later Chiron exhumed the body of the <a href="Damysus%20%28Giant%29">Damysus</a>, who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles' burnt foot.

Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man at the court of <a href="Lycomedes">Lycomedes</a>, king of <a href="Skyros">Skyros</a>. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter <a href="Deidamia%20%28mythology%29">Deidamia</a>, whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, <a href="Neoptolemus">Neoptolemus</a> (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet <a href="Calchas">Calchas</a> that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

According to the "Iliad", Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 <a href="Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, <a href="Eudorus">Eudorus</a>, Peisander, <a href="Phoenix%20%28son%20of%20Amyntor%29">Phoenix</a> and Alcimedon.

When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in <a href="Mysia">Mysia</a>, ruled by King <a href="Telephus">Telephus</a>. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.

According to other reports in <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>' <a href="lost%20works">lost play</a> about Telephus, he went to <a href="Aulis%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">Aulis</a> pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held <a href="Orestes%20%28mythology%29">Orestes</a> for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.

According to the "<a href="Cypria">Cypria</a>" (the part of the <a href="Epic%20Cycle">Epic Cycle</a> that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' wrath), when the <a href="Achaeans%20%28Homer%29">Achaeans</a> desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, sacked neighbouring cities (like <a href="Pedasus">Pedasus</a> and <a href="Lyrnessus">Lyrnessus</a>, where the Greeks capture the queen <a href="Briseis">Briseis</a>) and killed <a href="Tenes">Tenes</a>, a son of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, as well as Priam's son <a href="Troilus">Troilus</a> in the sanctuary of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> <a href="Thymbra">Thymbra</a>ios. However, the romance between Troilus and <a href="Chryseis">Chryseis</a> described in <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s "Troilus and Criseyde" and in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "Troilus and Cressida" is a medieval invention.

In <a href="Dares%20Phrygius">Dares Phrygius</a>' "Account of the Destruction of Troy", the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, as well as in older accounts, <a href="Troilus">Troilus</a> was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King <a href="Priam">Priam</a>'s and <a href="Hecuba">Hecuba</a>'s five legitimate sons (or according other sources, another son of Apollo). Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders, a "horse fighter" or "chariot fighter" according to Homer. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister <a href="Polyxena">Polyxena</a>, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo <a href="Thymbra">Thymbra</a>ios. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the <a href="First%20Vatican%20Mythographer">First Vatican Mythographer</a> claimed, Troy would have been invincible.

Homer's "Iliad" is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, "mênis Achilléōs") is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the "Iliad" read:
The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, the commander of the <a href="Achaeans%20%28Homer%29">Achaean</a> forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named <a href="Chryseis">Chryseis</a> as his slave. Her father <a href="Chryses">Chryses</a>, a priest of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet <a href="Calchas">Calchas</a> correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize <a href="Briseis">Briseis</a>, the daughter of <a href="Briseus">Briseus</a>, be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, <a href="Nestor%20%28mythology%29">Nestor</a> declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and two other chieftains, <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">Ajax</a> and <a href="Phoenix%20%28son%20of%20Amyntor%29">Phoenix</a>, to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

The Trojans, led by <a href="Hector">Hector</a>, subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a> leads the <a href="Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a> into battle, wearing Achilles' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from <a href="Antilochus">Antilochus</a>, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the <a href="Shield%20of%20Achilles">Shield of Achilles</a>, described in great detail in the poem.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god <a href="Scamander">Scamander</a>, who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by <a href="Hera">Hera</a> and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, <a href="Deiphobus">Deiphobus</a>, persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me". Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour.

With the assistance of the god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, Hector's father, <a href="Priam">Priam</a>, goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral. The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

The "<a href="Aethiopis">Aethiopis</a>" (7th century BC) and a work named "<a href="Posthomerica">Posthomerica</a>", composed by <a href="Quintus%20of%20Smyrna">Quintus of Smyrna</a> in the fourth century AD, relate further events from the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. When <a href="Penthesilea">Penthesilea</a>, queen of the <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a> and daughter of <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.

Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son <a href="Antilochus">Antilochus</a> becomes Achilles' closest companion. When <a href="Memnon%20%28mythology%29">Memnon</a>, son of the Dawn Goddess <a href="Eos">Eos</a> and king of <a href="Ethiopia%20%28mythology%29">Ethiopia</a>, slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise, until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the "Iliad"'s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the <a href="Epic%20Cycle">cyclic epic</a> "<a href="Aethiopis">Aethiopis</a>", which was composed after the "Iliad", possibly in the 7th century BC. The "Aethiopis" is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the "Iliad", it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. <a href="Homer">Homer</a> does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers. Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the "Iliad" that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a> to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the <a href="Pederasty%20in%20ancient%20Greece">Greek custom of "paiderasteia"</a>. In Plato's "Symposium", the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover. But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a> and <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a>, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.

The death of Achilles, as predicted by <a href="Hector">Hector</a> with his dying breath, was brought about by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a> with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, and funeral games were held. He was represented in the "Aethiopis" as living after his death in the island of <a href="Leuke">Leuke</a> at the mouth of the river <a href="Danube">Danube</a>.

Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, <a href="Polyxena">Polyxena</a>. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.

In the "Odyssey", Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his <a href="mound">mound</a> at the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a> while they are receiving the dead <a href="Suitors%20of%20Penelope">suitors</a> in Hades. He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the Ocean. Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus. Paris was later killed by <a href="Philoctetes">Philoctetes</a> using the enormous bow of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>.

In Book 11 of Homer's "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.

According to some accounts, he had married <a href="Medea">Medea</a> in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the <a href="Elysium">Elysian Fields</a> of <a href="Hades">Hades</a> – as Hera promised Thetis in <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Rhodes">Apollonius</a>' "<a href="Argonautica">Argonautica</a>" (3rd century BC).

Achilles' armour was the object of a feud between <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">Telamonian Ajax</a> (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men, decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to <a href="Neoptolemus">Neoptolemus</a>, the son of Achilles.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of <a href="Phaselis">Phaselis</a>, Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the "Iliad" with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear. However, it was shown in the time of <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> in the 2nd century AD.

Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">Ajax</a> were playing a <a href="board%20game">board game</a> ("petteia"). They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle. The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.

The tomb of Achilles, extant throughout antiquity in <a href="Troad">Troad</a>, was venerated by <a href="Thessalians">Thessalians</a>, but also by <a href="Persians">Persian</a> expeditionary forces, as well as by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and the Roman emperor <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>. Achilles' cult was also to be found at other places, e. g. on the island of <a href="Astypalaea">Astypalaea</a> in the <a href="Sporades">Sporades</a>, in <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> which had a sanctuary, in <a href="Elis">Elis</a> and in Achilles' homeland <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, as well as in the <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a> cities of <a href="Taranto">Tarentum</a>, <a href="Locri">Locri</a> and <a href="Crotone">Croton</a>, accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero.

The spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the <a href="Greeks%20in%20pre-Roman%20Crimea">Greeks</a> that had <a href="Second%20Greek%20colonisation">settled</a> on the northern coast of the <a href="Pontus%20Euxinus">Pontus Euxinus</a>, today's Black Sea, appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the <a href="Miletus">Milesian</a> colony of <a href="Olbia%20%28archaeological%20site%29">Olbia</a> as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with <a href="Snake%20Island%20%28Black%20Sea%29">Snake Island</a> (<a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> Зміїний, "Zmiinyi", near <a href="Kiliya">Kiliya</a>, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the <a href="Greek%20colonies">Greek colonies</a> on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> (<a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being <a href="votive%20offering">votive offering</a>s, from Olbia, the area of <a href="Berezan%20Island">Berezan Island</a> and the <a href="Tauric%20Chersonese">Tauric Chersonese</a>) attest the existence of a <a href="heroic%20cult">heroic cult</a> of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century AD, when dedicatory <a href="stelae">stelae</a> from Olbia refer to an "Achilles Pontárchēs" (Ποντάρχης, roughly "lord of the Sea," or "of the <a href="Pontus%20Euxinus">Pontus Euxinus</a>"), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with <a href="Olympian%20gods">Olympian gods</a> such as the local <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> Prostates, <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> Agoraeus, or <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>.

<a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> (23–79 AD) in his "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>" mentions a "port of the Achæi" and an "island of Achilles", famous for the tomb of that "man" (portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the <a href="Dnieper-Bug%20Estuary">Dnieper-Bug Estuary</a>; furthermore, at 125 <a href="Roman%20mile">Roman mile</a>s from this island, he places a peninsula "which stretches forth in the shape of a sword" obliquely, called "Dromos Achilleos" (Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος, "Achilléōs drómos" "<a href="Racecourse%20of%20Achilles">the Race-course of Achilles</a>") and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him. This last feature of Pliny's account is considered to be the iconic <a href="Spit%20%28landform%29">spit</a>, called today "Tendra" (or "Kosa Tendra" and "Kosa Djarilgatch"), situated between the mouth of the <a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a> and <a href="Karkinit%20Bay">Karkinit Bay</a>, but which is hardly 125 <a href="Roman%20mile">Roman mile</a>s (c. 185 km) away from the <a href="Dnieper-Bug%20estuary">Dnieper-Bug estuary</a>, as Pliny states. (To the "Race-course" he gives a length of 80 miles, c. 120 km, whereas the spit measures c. 70 km today.)

In the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as "Achillea" and introduces two further names for it: "Leuce" or "Macaron" (from Greek [νῆσος] μακαρῶν "island of the blest"). The "present day" measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of "Achillea" or "Leuce" with today's Snake Island. Pliny's contemporary <a href="Pomponius%20Mela">Pomponius Mela</a> (c. 43 AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named "Achillea", situated between the <a href="Borysthenes">Borysthenes</a> and the <a href="Danube">Ister</a>, adding to the geographical confusion. Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823 on Snake Island. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC <a href="Black-glazed%20Ware">black-glazed</a> <a href="lekythos">lekythos</a> inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: "Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke." In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.

The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on "Leuce" seems to go back to an account from the lost epic "<a href="Aethiopis">Aethiopis</a>" according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical Λεύκη Νῆσος ("Leúkē Nêsos" "White Island"). Already in the fifth century BC, <a href="Pindar">Pindar</a> had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a "bright island" (φαεννά νᾶσος, "phaenná nâsos") of the Black Sea, while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite <a href="Island%20of%20the%20Blest">Island of the Blest</a> together with other heroes such as his father <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a> and <a href="Cadmus">Cadmus</a>. Well known is the connection of these mythological <a href="Fortunate%20Isles">Fortunate Isles</a> (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, "makárôn nêsoi") or the Homeric <a href="Elysium">Elysium</a> with the stream <a href="Oceanus">Oceanus</a> which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it. Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by <a href="Alcaeus%20of%20Mytilene">Alcaeus</a>, speaking of "Achilles lord of Scythia" and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles' fight against the <a href="Aethiopia">Aethiopia</a>n prince <a href="Memnon%20%28mythology%29">Memnon</a>, who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother <a href="Eos">Eos</a> after his death.

The "<a href="Periplus%20Ponti%20Euxini">Periplus of the Euxine Sea</a>" (c. 130 AD) gives the following details:

The Greek geographer <a href="Dionysius%20Periegetes">Dionysius Periegetes</a>, who lived probably during the first century AD, wrote that the island was called "Leuce" "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour". Similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there. <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles' temple and his statue". Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>c <a href="Pythia">Pythia</a> sent a lord of <a href="Crotone">Croton</a> to be cured of a chest wound. <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> attributes the healing to waters ("aquae") on the island.

A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> reported on the existence of a town "Achílleion" (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from <a href="Mytilene">Mytilene</a> in the sixth century BC, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the <a href="Troad">Troad</a>. Later attestations point to an "Achílleion" in <a href="Messenia">Messenia</a> (according to <a href="Stephanus%20Byzantinus">Stephanus Byzantinus</a>) and an "Achílleios" (Ἀχίλλειος) in <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a>. <a href="Nicolae%20Densu%C5%9Fianu">Nicolae Densuşianu</a> recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a> and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called <a href="Chilia%20Veche">Chilia</a> (presumably from an older "Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.

The kings of <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epirus</a> claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, <a href="Neoptolemus">Neoptolemus</a>. <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, son of the Epirote princess <a href="Olympias">Olympias</a>, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at <a href="Achilleion%20%28Troad%29%23Tomb%20of%20Achilles">Achilleion</a> while passing Troy. In AD 216 the Roman Emperor <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>, while on his way to war against <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>, emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.

The <a href="tragedy">Greek tragedian</a> <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title "Achilleis" by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of <a href="Hector">Hector</a> and eventual death when an arrow shot by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a> and guided by <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the "Achilleis" and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the "Achilleis" trilogy, "The Myrmidons", focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today. In Plato's "Symposium", Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.

The tragedian <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> also wrote "The Lovers of Achilles", a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.

Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in "<a href="Hecuba%20%28play%29">Hecuba</a>", "<a href="Electra%20%28Euripides%29">Electra</a>", and "<a href="Iphigenia%20in%20Aulis">Iphigenia in Aulis</a>".

The philosopher <a href="Zeno%20of%20Elea">Zeno of Elea</a> centered one of <a href="Zeno%27s%20paradoxes">his paradoxes</a> on an imaginary footrace between "<a href="Epithets%20in%20Homer%23Individuals">swift-footed</a>" <a href="Zeno%27s%20paradoxes%23Achilles%20and%20the%20tortoise">Achilles and a tortoise</a>, by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles. <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men, while <a href="Horace">Horace</a> portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children. Other writers, such as <a href="Catullus">Catullus</a>, <a href="Propertius">Propertius</a>, and <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>, represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as <a href="Dictys%20Cretensis">Dictys Cretensis</a> and <a href="Dares%20Phrygius">Dares Phrygius</a> and in <a href="Beno%C3%AEt%20de%20Sainte-Maure">Benoît de Sainte-Maure</a>'s "<a href="Roman%20de%20Troie">Roman de Troie</a>" and <a href="Guido%20delle%20Colonne">Guido delle Colonne</a>'s "<a href="Historia%20destructionis%20Troiae">Historia destructionis Troiae</a>", which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the <a href="Matter%20of%20Troy">Matter of Troy</a> until the 17th century.

Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler <a href="Leo%20the%20Deacon">Leo the Deacon</a>, not as <a href="Hellenes">Hellene</a>, but as <a href="Scythians">Scythian</a>, while according to the Byzantine author <a href="John%20Malalas">John Malalas</a>, his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a>.



Achilles has been frequently the subject of operas, ballets and related genres.


In films Achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series:

In 1890, <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Bavaria">Elisabeth of Bavaria</a>, Empress of Austria, had a summer palace built in <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>. The building is named the "<a href="Achilleion%20%28Corfu%29">Achilleion</a>", after Achilles. Its paintings and statuary depict scenes from the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>, with particular focus on Achilles.

Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and <a href="lawyer">lawyer</a> who served as the 16th <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> from March 1861 until <a href="assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">his assassination</a> in April 1865. Lincoln led the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> through the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>—its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. In doing so, he preserved the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a>, <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">abolished slavery</a>, strengthened the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal government</a>, and modernized <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20United%20States">the economy</a>.

Born in <a href="Hodgenville%2C%20Kentucky">Hodgenville, Kentucky</a>, Lincoln grew up on the <a href="American%20frontier">western frontier</a> in <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> and <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>. Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> leader, and was elected to the <a href="Illinois%20House%20of%20Representatives">Illinois House of Representatives</a>, in which he served for eight years. Elected to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy and opposed the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. After a single term, he returned to Illinois and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new <a href="history%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republican Party</a>, which had a statewide majority in Illinois. As part of the 1858 campaign for US Senator from Illinois, Lincoln took part in a <a href="Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas%20debates">series of highly publicized debates</a> with his opponent and rival, <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a>; Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of <a href="slavery">slavery</a>, but lost the race to Douglas. In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a>, though most delegates originally favored other candidates. Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>, he swept the <a href="Northern%20United%20States">North</a> and was <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">elected president in 1860</a>.

Though there were attempts to bridge the differences between North and South, ultimately Lincoln's victory prompted seven southern slave states to secede from the United States and form the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> before he moved into the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. U.S. troops refused to leave <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, a fort located in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, after the secession of the Southern States. The resulting Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to rally behind the Union. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted <a href="Radical%20Republican">Radical Republican</a>s, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; <a href="War%20Democrats">War Democrats</a>, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called <a href="Copperhead%20%28politics%29">Copperheads</a>), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political <a href="patronage">patronage</a> and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. His <a href="Gettysburg%20Address">Gettysburg Address</a> became an iconic endorsement of <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>, <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a>, <a href="Civil%20and%20political%20rights">equal rights</a>, <a href="liberty">liberty</a>, and <a href="democracy">democracy</a>. He suspended "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>", leading to the controversial "<a href="Ex%20parte%20Merryman">Ex parte Merryman</a>" decision, and he averted potential <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> intervention by defusing the <a href="Trent%20Affair">"Trent" Affair</a>. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of generals, including his most successful general, <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. He made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a <a href="Union%20blockade">naval blockade</a> that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the <a href="Border%20States%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a> to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>, which permanently outlawed slavery.

An astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">1864 presidential election</a>. Anticipating the war's conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of <a href="Reconstruction%20Era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate general <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, Lincoln was shot by Confederate sympathizer <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> and died the next day. Lincoln has been consistently <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Scholar%20survey%20results">ranked</a> both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.

Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, as the second child of <a href="Thomas%20Lincoln">Thomas</a> and <a href="Nancy%20Lincoln">Nancy Hanks Lincoln</a>, in a one-room log cabin on the <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20Birthplace%20National%20Historical%20Park">Sinking Spring Farm</a> near <a href="Hodgenville%2C%20Kentucky">Hodgenville, Kentucky</a>. He was a descendant of <a href="Samuel%20Lincoln">Samuel Lincoln</a>, an Englishman who migrated from <a href="Hingham%2C%20Norfolk">Hingham, Norfolk</a>, to its namesake of <a href="Hingham%2C%20Massachusetts">Hingham, Massachusetts</a>, in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's western migration, which passed through <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20%28captain%29">Captain Abraham Lincoln</a>, moved the family from Virginia to <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jefferson County, Kentucky</a>, in the 1780s. Captain Lincoln was killed in an <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">Indian raid</a> in 1786. His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, the future president's father, witnessed the attack. After his father's murder, Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier, working at odd jobs in Kentucky and in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, before settling with members of his family in <a href="Hardin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hardin County, Kentucky</a>, in the early 1800s.
Lincoln's mother, Nancy, is widely assumed to have been the daughter of Lucy Hanks, although no record of Nancy Hanks' birth has ever been found. According to William Ensign Lincoln's book "The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln", Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks; however, the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock. Still another researcher, Adin Baber, claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.

Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky">Elizabethtown, Kentucky</a>, following their marriage. They became the parents of three children: Sarah, born on February 10, 1807; Abraham, on February 12, 1809; and another son, Thomas, who died in infancy. Thomas Lincoln bought or leased several farms in Kentucky, including the Sinking Spring farm, where Abraham was born; however, a land title dispute soon forced the Lincolns to move. In 1811, the family moved north, to <a href="Knob%20Creek%20Farm">Knob Creek Farm</a>, where Thomas acquired title to of land. In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm. Of the that Thomas held in Kentucky, he lost all but of his land in court disputes over property titles. Frustrated over the lack of security provided by the Kentucky title survey system in the courts, Thomas sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814, and began planning a move to <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure.

In 1816, the family moved north across the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> to <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, a free, non-slaveholding territory, where they settled in an "unbroken forest" in Hurricane Township, <a href="Perry%20County%2C%20Indiana%23History">Perry County</a>. (Their land in southern Indiana became part of <a href="Spencer%20County%2C%20Indiana">Spencer County, Indiana</a>, when the county was established in 1818.) The farm is preserved as part of the <a href="Lincoln%20Boyhood%20National%20Memorial">Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial</a>. In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was "partly on account of slavery"; but mainly due to land title difficulties in Kentucky. During the family's years in Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas Lincoln worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter. He owned farms, several town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. Thomas and Nancy Lincoln were also members of a <a href="Separate%20Baptists">Separate Baptists</a> church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. Within a year of the family's arrival in Indiana, Thomas claimed title to of Indiana land. Despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to of land in what became known as the <a href="Little%20Pigeon%20Creek%20Community">Little Pigeon Creek Community</a> in Spencer County. Prior to the family's move to Illinois in 1830, Thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property.

Several significant family events took place during Lincoln's youth in Indiana. On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died of <a href="milk%20sickness">milk sickness</a>, leaving eleven-year-old <a href="Sarah%20Lincoln%20Grigsby">Sarah</a> in charge of a household that included her father, nine-year-old Abraham, and Dennis Hanks, Nancy's nineteen-year-old orphaned cousin. On December 2, 1819, Lincoln's father married <a href="Sarah%20Bush%20Lincoln">Sarah "Sally" Bush Johnston</a>, a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own. Abraham became very close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as "Mother". Those who knew Lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister Sarah's death on January 20, 1828, while giving birth to a <a href="stillborn">stillborn</a> son.

As a youth, Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his "reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.", and must have done it to avoid manual labor. His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy "physical labor", but loved to read. Lincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent, the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. Family, neighbors, and schoolmates of Lincoln's youth recalled that he read and reread the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Bible</a>, <a href="Aesop%27s%20Fables">Aesop's Fables</a>, <a href="John%20Bunyan">John Bunyan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Progress">The Pilgrim's Progress</a>", <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>'s "<a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a>", <a href="Mason%20Locke%20Weems">Mason Locke Weems</a>'s "The Life of Washington", and "<a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Benjamin%20Franklin">The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</a>", among others.

As he grew into his teens, Lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household. He also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty-one. Abraham became adept at using an axe. Tall for his age, Lincoln was also strong and athletic. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as "the Clary's Grove boys".

In early March 1830, partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, several members of the extended Lincoln family moved west to Illinois, a non-slaveholding state, and settled in <a href="Macon%20County%2C%20Illinois">Macon County</a>, west of <a href="Decatur%2C%20Illinois">Decatur</a>. Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to leave Indiana, and one possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, might not have attained the stability and steady income that Thomas Lincoln had. After the family relocated to Illinois, Abraham became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education, but occasionally lent him money. In 1831, as Thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a <a href="Lincoln%20Log%20Cabin%20State%20Historic%20Site">new homestead</a> in <a href="Coles%20County%2C%20Illinois">Coles County, Illinois</a>, Abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own. Traveling down the <a href="Sangamon%20River">Sangamon River</a>, he ended up in the village of <a href="Lincoln%27s%20New%20Salem">New Salem</a> in <a href="Sangamon%20County%2C%20Illinois">Sangamon County</a>. Later that spring, <a href="Denton%20Offutt">Denton Offutt</a>, a New Salem merchant, hired Lincoln and some friends to take goods by <a href="flatboat">flatboat</a> from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—Lincoln returned to New Salem, where he remained for the next six years.

According to some sources, Lincoln's first romantic interest was <a href="Ann%20Rutledge">Ann Rutledge</a>, whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>. In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.

Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.

In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to <a href="Mary%20Todd%20Lincoln">Mary Todd</a>, who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>. They met in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a> in December 1839 and were engaged the following December.
A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative. They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose." In 1844, the couple bought <a href="Lincoln%20Home%20National%20Historic%20Site">a house</a> in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.

He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children. <a href="Robert%20Todd%20Lincoln">Robert Todd Lincoln</a> was born in 1843 and <a href="Edward%20Baker%20Lincoln">Edward Baker Lincoln</a> (Eddie) in 1846. Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis. <a href="William%20Wallace%20Lincoln">"Willie" Lincoln</a> was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son, <a href="Tad%20Lincoln">Thomas "Tad" Lincoln</a>, was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871. Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. The Lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson <a href="Robert%20Todd%20Lincoln%20Beckwith">Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith</a>, died in 1985. Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children", and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own.

The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Abraham Lincoln suffered from "<a href="history%20of%20depression">melancholy</a>", a condition which now is referred to as <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">clinical depression</a>. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.
Lincoln's father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington.

During his term as President of the United States, Mary was known to cook for Lincoln often. Since she was raised by a wealthy family, her cooking abilities were simple, but satisfied Lincoln's tastes, which included, particularly, imported oysters.

In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner (<a href="Denton%20Offutt">Denton Offutt</a>) bought a small general store on credit in <a href="Lincoln%27s%20New%20Salem">New Salem</a>, Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the <a href="Illinois%20General%20Assembly">Illinois General Assembly</a>. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural <a href="raconteur">raconteur</a> in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.

Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the <a href="Black%20Hawk%20War">Black Hawk War</a>. Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At , he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival". At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him. Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.

Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading <a href="William%20Blackstone">Blackstone</a>'s "<a href="Commentaries%20on%20the%20Laws%20of%20England">Commentaries on the Laws of England</a>" and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody". His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a>, many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.
<a href="Admission%20to%20the%20bar%20in%20the%20United%20States">Admitted</a> to the Illinois bar in 1836, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under <a href="John%20T.%20Stuart">John T. Stuart</a>, Mary Todd's cousin. Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with <a href="Stephen%20T.%20Logan">Stephen T. Logan</a> from 1841 until 1844. Then Lincoln began <a href="Lincoln-Herndon%20Law%20Offices%20State%20Historic%20Site">his practice</a> with <a href="William%20Herndon%20%28lawyer%29">William Herndon</a>, whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man".

Successful on his second run for office, Lincoln served four successive terms in the <a href="Illinois%20House%20of%20Representatives">Illinois House of Representatives</a> as a Whig representative from Sangamon County. He supported the construction of the <a href="Illinois%20and%20Michigan%20Canal">Illinois and Michigan Canal</a>, which he remained involved with later as a Canal Commissioner. In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not. He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and <a href="abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionism</a>. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils." His stance closely followed <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> in supporting the <a href="American%20Colonization%20Society">American Colonization Society</a> program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a> in Africa.

From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay". The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.

Lincoln ran for the Whig nomination for Illinois's 7th district of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> in 1843, but was defeated by <a href="John%20J.%20Hardin">John J. Hardin</a>. However, Lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby Hardin would retire after only one term to allow for the nomination of another candidate. Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846. Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman <a href="Joshua%20R.%20Giddings">Joshua R. Giddings</a>, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the <a href="Washington%2C%20District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a> with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.

On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>, which he attributed to <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">President Polk</a>'s desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood". Lincoln also supported the <a href="Wilmot%20Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a>, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.
Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his <a href="Spot%20Resolutions">Spot Resolutions</a>. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded "our territory" and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our "own soil"". Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.

Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln". Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.

Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> for the Whig nomination in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201848">1848 presidential election</a>. Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a>, but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, <a href="Justin%20Butterfield">Justin Butterfield</a>, considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an "old fossil". The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.

Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer". Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a <a href="Hurd%20v.%20Rock%20Island%20Bridge%20Company">landmark case</a> involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849, he received <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%27s%20patent">a patent for a flotation device</a> for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.

In 1851, he represented the <a href="Alton%20Railroad">Alton & Sangamon Railroad</a> in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Illinois">Illinois Supreme Court</a> has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation. Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor. From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central Railroad</a>. Lincoln's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname "Honest Abe".

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended <a href="William%20%26quot%3BDuff%26quot%3B%20Armstrong">William "Duff" Armstrong</a>, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by <a href="judicial%20notice">judicial notice</a> in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a "<a href="Farmers%27%20Almanac">Farmers' Almanac</a>" showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.

Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding South and the North, and the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a> failed to defuse the issue. In the early 1850s, Lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for Henry Clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to "both extremes" on the slavery issue. As the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the <a href="Nebraska%20Territory">Nebraska Territory</a> and <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas Territory</a> became particularly acrimonious, and Senator <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> of Illinois proposed <a href="Popular%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Emergence%20of%20the%20term%20%26quot%3Bpopular%20sovereignty%26quot%3B%20and%20its%20pejorative%20connotation">popular sovereignty</a> as a compromise measure; the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of Congress by allowing the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves. The proposal alarmed many Northerners, who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories. Despite this Northern opposition, Douglas's <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a> narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.

For months after its passage, Lincoln did not publicly comment on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, but he came to strongly oppose it. On October 16, 1854, in his "<a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%27s%20Peoria%20speech">Peoria Speech</a>", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a ""declared" indifference, but as I must think, a covert "real" zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ..." Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.

Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting the demise of his party, Lincoln would write in 1855, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I do no more than oppose the "extension" of slavery." Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil</a>, <a href="Liberty%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201840%29">Liberty</a>, and antislavery <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> members, the new <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. Lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists. Lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing Whig Party, though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist <a href="Know%20Nothing">Know Nothing</a> movement.

In the 1854 elections, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. In the aftermath of the elections, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Lincoln instead sought election to the United States Senate. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting, but unable to obtain a majority, Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for <a href="Lyman%20Trumbull">Lyman Trumbull</a>. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, <a href="Joel%20Aldrich%20Matteson">Joel Aldrich Matteson</a>.

In part due to the ongoing <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">violent political confrontations in the Kansas</a>, opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong in Illinois and throughout the North. As the <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%201856">1856 elections</a> approached, Lincoln abandoned the defunct Whig Party in favor of the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 <a href="Bloomington%20Convention">Bloomington Convention</a>, which formally established the <a href="Illinois%20Republican%20Party">Illinois Republican Party</a>. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Lost%20Speech">final speech</a> of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June <a href="1856%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1856 Republican National Convention</a>, Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> and <a href="William%20Dayton">William Dayton</a>. Lincoln strongly supported the Republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories, while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>. In the 1856 elections, Buchanan defeated both his challengers, but Frémont won several Northern states and Republican <a href="William%20Henry%20Bissell">William Henry Bissell</a> won election as Governor of Illinois. Though Lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.

<a href="Eric%20Foner">Eric Foner</a> (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the <a href="republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republicanism principles</a> of the <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Founding Fathers</a>, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>.

In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>". The opinion by Chief Justice <a href="Roger%20B.%20Taney">Roger B. Taney</a> held that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. While many Democrats hoped that "Dred Scott" would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North. Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the <a href="Slave%20Power">Slave Power</a>. Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'."

Douglas was up for re-election in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator, many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party. Some eastern Republicans favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the <a href="Lecompton%20Constitution">Lecompton Constitution</a>, which would have admitted Kansas as a <a href="slave%20state">slave state</a>. But many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.

Accepting the nomination, Lincoln delivered his <a href="Lincoln%27s%20House%20Divided%20Speech">House Divided Speech</a>, drawing on Mark 3:25, "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator. On being informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, "[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party ... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won."

The Senate campaign featured the seven <a href="Lincoln%E2%80%93Douglas%20debates">Lincoln–Douglas debates</a> of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that "<a href="The%20Slave%20Power">The Slave Power</a>" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that <a href="all%20men%20are%20created%20equal">all men are created equal</a>, while Douglas emphasized his <a href="Freeport%20Doctrine">Freeport Doctrine</a>, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the "Dred Scott" decision.

Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the "Illinois Staats-Anzeiger", a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1860, with <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a>, <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a>, <a href="Edward%20Bates">Edward Bates</a>, and <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a> looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.

On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a <a href="Cooper%20Union%20speech">speech at Cooper Union</a> to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong". Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist <a href="Noah%20Brooks">Noah Brooks</a> reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience."

Historian <a href="David%20Herbert%20Donald">Donald</a> described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery". In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste "is" in my mouth a little."

On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by <a href="David%20Davis%20%28Supreme%20Court%20justice%29">David Davis</a>, <a href="Norman%20B.%20Judd">Norman Judd</a>, <a href="Leonard%20Swett">Leonard Swett</a>, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency. Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate". In 1860 Lincoln described himself: "I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes."

On May 18, at the <a href="1860%20Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican National Convention</a> in Chicago, Lincoln became the Republican candidate on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, <a href="Hannibal%20Hamlin">Hannibal Hamlin</a> of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.

On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs. Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me".

Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the "Dred Scott" decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the <a href="1860%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic convention</a>, disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected incumbent Vice President <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> as their candidate. A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Union Party</a> and nominated <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a> of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas would compete for votes in the North,
while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.

Lincoln had a highly effective campaign team who carefully projected his image as an ideal candidate. As Michael Martinez says:

Lincoln and his political advisers manipulated his image and background...Sometimes he appeared as a straight-shooting, plain-talking, common-sense-wielding man of the people. His image as the "Rail Splitter" dates from this era. His supporters also portrayed him as "Honest Abe," the country fellow who was simply dressed and not especially polished or formal in his manner but who was as honest and trustworthy as his legs were long. Even Lincoln's tall, gangly frame was used to good advantage during the campaign as many drawings and posters show the candidates sprinting past his vertically challenged rivals. At other times, Lincoln appeared as a sophisticated, thoughtful, articulate, "presidential" candidate.

Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the <a href="Wide%20Awakes">Wide Awakes</a>, which it used to generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing <a href="slavery">slavery</a> grew, so did his supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.

As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a "Chicago Tribune" writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.

Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2 percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln. Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.

Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">electoral college</a> was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were <a href="Electoral%20fusion">fusion tickets</a> in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.

As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>. The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.

There were attempts at compromise. The <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a> would have extended the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform. Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right."

Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed <a href="Corwin%20Amendment">Corwin Amendment</a> to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.

En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. The president-elect then <a href="Baltimore%20Plot">evaded possible assassins</a> in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, <a href="Allan%20Pinkerton">Allan Pinkerton</a>. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. Lincoln directed <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%27s%20first%20inaugural%20address">his inaugural address</a> to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:

The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature." The failure of the <a href="Peace%20Conference%20of%201861">Peace Conference of 1861</a> signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. Lincoln said as the war was ending:

The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28Civil%20War%29">Major Robert Anderson</a>, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, forcing them to surrender, beginning the war. Historian <a href="Allan%20Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.

<a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war. Historian <a href="David%20Herbert%20Donald">David Herbert Donald</a> concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that."

On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral. The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the <a href="Mason-Dixon%20line">Mason-Dixon line</a> to the defense of the American nation. Historian Allan Nevins says:
States sent Union regiments south in response to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, <a href="Baltimore%20riot%20of%201861">attacked Union troops</a> who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting <a href="Maryland%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War%23Imposition%20of%20martial%20law">local Maryland</a> officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of "<a href="Habeas%20corpus%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Suspension%20during%20the%20Civil%20War">habeas corpus</a>" in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. <a href="John%20Merryman">John Merryman</a>, a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, <a href="Roger%20B.%20Taney">Roger B. Taney</a>, author of the controversial pro-slavery "Dred Scott" opinion, to issue a writ of "habeas corpus", and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the <a href="Ex%20parte%20Merryman">Ex parte Merryman</a> ruling.

Before the Civil War, the only money issued by the United States was <a href="gold">gold</a> and <a href="silver">silver</a> coins, and only such coins ("specie") were <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a>; that is, payment in that form had to be accepted. Paper currency in the form of <a href="banknote">banknote</a>s was issued by privately owned banks.

<a href="Greenback%20%281860s%20money%29">Greenbacks</a> were paper currency (printed in <a href="green">green</a> on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">back</a>) issued by the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">United States</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, they were in two forms:

<a href="Demand%20Note">Demand Note</a>s, issued In July 1861, Congress authorized $50,000,000 in Demand Notes. They bore no interest, but could be redeemed for specie "on demand". They were not legal tender (before March 1862), but like Treasury Notes could be used to pay customs duties. Unlike private and state banknotes, Demand Notes were printed on both sides. The <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse side</a> was printed in green ink, and so the Demand Notes were dubbed "greenbacks". Initially they were discounted relative to gold, but being fully redeemable in gold were soon at par. In December 1861, the government had to suspend redemption, and they declined. Chase authorized paying interest on Demand Notes, which sustained their value. Importers therefore continued to use Demand Notes in place of gold. In March 1862, Demand Notes were made legal tender. As Demand Notes were used to pay duties, they were taken out of circulation. By mid-1863, about 95% of them were gone.

The other form of greenbacks where the <a href="United%20States%20Note">United States Note</a>s issued in 1862–1865. They were <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> by law, but were not backed by <a href="gold">gold</a> or <a href="silver">silver</a>, only the credibility of the U.S. government. Could "not" be used to pay customs duties or interest on the public debt.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Battle of Fort Sumter</a>, Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and forming an overall <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> military strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a>, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending "habeas corpus", arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.

The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the <a href="Confiscation%20Act%20of%201861">Confiscation Act</a> that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.

In late August 1861, General <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a>, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting his superiors in Washington, a proclamation of <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>ed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20West">Department of the West</a> compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political, neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.

In foreign policy, Lincoln's main goal was to stop military aid from countries abroad to the Confederacy. Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. At times Seward was too bellicose, so for balance Lincoln maintained a close working relationship with Senator <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a>, the chairman of the <a href="Senate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Committee">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a>. The <a href="Trent%20Affair">Trent Affair</a> of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the "Trent", on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer <a href="James%20G.%20Randall">James G. Randall</a> has dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:
Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the <a href="United%20States%20War%20Department">War Department</a> headquarters. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a> with <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a> as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">War Secretary</a>. Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and cancelling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000. Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless, he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. "Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together," say Thomas and Hyman.

In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist <a href="Antoine-Henri%20Jomini">Jomini</a>; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg</a> and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.

After the Union rout at <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Bull Run</a>, the first major battle of the Civil War, and the retirement of the aged <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.

Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief in March 1862, after McClellan's "Harrison's Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. The office remained empty until July, when <a href="Henry%20Halleck">Henry Halleck</a> was selected for it. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">John Pope</a>, a Republican, as head of the new <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a>. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack.

However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a> in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the <a href="CSS%20Virginia">CSS "Virginia"</a>, formerly the USS "Merrimack", damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the <a href="USS%20Monitor">USS "Monitor"</a>. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hampton%20Roads">Battle of Hampton Roads</a>.

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s forces crossed the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> into Maryland, leading to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.

McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a> likewise refused orders to move the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Ohio">Army of the Ohio</a> against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with <a href="William%20Rosecrans">William Rosecrans</a>; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a>. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.

Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the <a href="Rappahannock%20River">Rappahannock River</a> and was stunningly <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg</a> in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>, despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.

The <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201862">mid-term elections</a> in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of "habeas corpus", <a href="Conscription">the military draft law</a>, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.

While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati "Gazette" contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".

In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, Grant on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.

Hooker was routed by Lee at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a> in May, but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in <a href="Harper%27s%20Ferry">Harper's Ferry</a>, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by <a href="George%20Meade">George Meade</a>, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the <a href="Gettysburg%20Campaign">Gettysburg Campaign</a>, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor. After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.

Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept <a href="compensated%20emancipation">compensated emancipation</a> in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Founding Fathers</a>, under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General <a href="David%20Hunter">David Hunter</a> in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.

On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July, the <a href="Confiscation%20Act%20of%201862">Confiscation Act of 1862</a> was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free".

Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However, Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a> of the highly influential "New York Tribune" fell for the ploy, and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. Although he said he personally wished all men could be free, Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U.S. president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was that of preserving the Union:

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.

Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20on%20slavery%23Colonization">colonies</a> for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the <a href="War%20Governors%27%20Conference">War Governors' Conference</a>; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.

Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once". By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General <a href="Lorenzo%20Thomas">Lorenzo Thomas</a> had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color".

With the great Union victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the <a href="New%20York%20City%20draft%20riots">New York City draft riots</a>. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863. Defying Lincoln's prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.

In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.

Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s victories at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> and in the <a href="Vicksburg%20campaign">Vicksburg campaign</a> impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I can't spare this man. He fights." With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.

Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.

Grant waged his bloody <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a> in 1864. This is often characterized as a <a href="attrition%20warfare">war of attrition</a>, given high Union losses at battles such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wilderness">Battle of the Wilderness</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Cold%20Harbor">Cold Harbor</a>. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces". The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."

The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the <a href="James%20River">James River</a>, forcing a <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">siege</a> and trench warfare outside <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Virginia">Petersburg, Virginia</a>. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.

Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a> to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>. The damage caused by <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">Sherman's March to the Sea</a> through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. <a href="Mark%20E.%20Neely%20Jr.">Mark E. Neely Jr.</a> has argued that there was no effort to engage in "<a href="total%20war">total war</a>" against civilians which he believed did take place during World War II.

Confederate general <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a> began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Stevens">raid on Washington, D.C.</a> in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a> shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!" After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.

As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Stephens">Stephens</a> led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at <a href="Hampton%20Roads%20Conference">Hampton Roads</a>. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Five%20Forks">Battle of Five Forks</a> and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but <a href="freedmen">freedmen</a> greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at <a href="Appomattox%20Court%20House%20National%20Historical%20Park">Appomattox</a> and the war was effectively over.

While the war was still being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in <a href="War%20Democrats">War Democrats</a> such as <a href="Edwin%20M.%20Stanton">Edwin M. Stanton</a> and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new <a href="National%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Union Party</a>.

When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:

While the Democratic platform followed the "Peace wing" of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and <a href="David%20Farragut">David Farragut</a>'s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the <a href="perfidy">perfidy</a> of the Copperheads. On November 8, Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.

On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his <a href="Lincoln%27s%20second%20inaugural%20address">second inaugural address</a>. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian <a href="Mark%20Noll">Mark Noll</a> concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world". Lincoln said:

Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy." In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, Sen. <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a> and Sen. <a href="Benjamin%20Wade">Benjamin Wade</a>, political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His <a href="Ten%20percent%20plan">Amnesty Proclamation</a> of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.

As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and <a href="Frederick%20Steele">Frederick Steele</a> as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General <a href="Nathaniel%20P.%20Banks">Nathaniel P. Banks</a> to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the <a href="Wade-Davis%20Bill">Wade-Davis Bill</a>, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.

Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter". By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. Upon ratification, it became the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> on December 6, 1865.

As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a> bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. Lincoln biographers <a href="James%20G.%20Randall">James G. Randall</a> and <a href="Richard%20Current">Richard Current</a>, according to David Lincove, argue that:
<a href="Eric%20Foner">Eric Foner</a> argues that:
The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.

In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of "republican values". As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism. The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself." His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.

In March 1861, in Lincoln's <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%27s%20first%20inaugural%20address">first inaugural address</a>, he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people."
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the <a href="Homestead%20Act">Homestead Act</a> in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The <a href="Morrill%20Land-Grant%20Colleges%20Act">Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</a>, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The <a href="Pacific%20Railway%20Acts">Pacific Railway Acts</a> of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a>, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.
Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third <a href="Morrill%20Tariff">Morrill Tariff</a>, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the <a href="Revenue%20Act%20of%201861">Revenue Act of 1861</a>, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the <a href="Revenue%20Act%20of%201862">Revenue Act of 1862</a> to a progressive rate structure.

Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the <a href="National%20Banking%20Act">National Banking Act</a> provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a>. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the "<a href="Dakota%20War%20of%201862">Sioux Uprising</a>" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted <a href="Sioux%23Santee%20%28Is%C3%A1%C5%8Byathi%20or%20Eastern%20Dakota%29">Santee Dakota</a> who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.

In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>" and the "<a href="The%20Journal%20of%20Commerce">Journal of Commerce</a>" published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.

Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving holiday</a> in the United States. Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>'s presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite National Park</a>.

Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known." Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. <a href="Noah%20Haynes%20Swayne">Noah Haynes Swayne</a>, nominated January 21, 1862, and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. <a href="Samuel%20Freeman%20Miller">Samuel Freeman Miller</a>, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862, and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. <a href="Stephen%20Johnson%20Field">Stephen Johnson Field</a>, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863, and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.

Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, and 27 judges to the <a href="United%20States%20district%20courts">United States district courts</a>. Lincoln appointed no judges to the <a href="United%20States%20circuit%20court">United States circuit court</a>s during his time in office.

<a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at <a href="Ford%27s%20Theatre">Ford's Theatre</a> as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination occurred five days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Learning that the President and Grant would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater, as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes. Without his main bodyguard, <a href="Ward%20Hill%20Lamon">Ward Hill Lamon</a>, Lincoln left to attend the play "<a href="Our%20American%20Cousin">Our American Cousin</a>" on April 14. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major <a href="Henry%20Rathbone">Henry Rathbone</a> momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.

After being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some south of Washington. After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant <a href="Boston%20Corbett">Boston Corbett</a> on April 26.

Doctor <a href="Charles%20Leale">Charles Leale</a>, an Army surgeon, found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse. Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally. The dying President was taken across the street to <a href="Petersen%20House">Petersen House</a>. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. According to eyewitnesses, he face was fixed in a smile when he expired. Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach "United States" and for three weeks the "Lincoln Special" <a href="Funeral%20and%20burial%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln%23Funeral%20train">funeral train</a> decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by. Poet <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> composed "<a href="When%20Lilacs%20Last%20in%20the%20Dooryard%20Bloom%27d">When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd</a>" to eulogize Lincoln, one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president. Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news. African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their <a href="Moses">Moses</a>'. In a larger sense, the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended.

As a young man, Lincoln was a <a href="religious%20skepticism">religious skeptic</a>, or, in the words of a biographer, an <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclast</a>. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly <a href="evangelicalism">evangelical</a> Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.

In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the <a href="Doctrine%20of%20Necessity">Doctrine of Necessity</a>, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. In the 1850s, Lincoln believed in "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God. The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace. After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun, He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds." On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>.

Several claims abound that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on <a href="list%20of%20photographs%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">photographs</a> appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder, <a href="multiple%20endocrine%20neoplasia%20type%202b">MEN2b</a>, which manifests with a <a href="medullary%20thyroid%20carcinoma">medullary thyroid carcinoma</a>, <a href="mucosal%20neuromata%20with%20endocrine%20tumors">mucosal neuromas</a> and a <a href="marfanoid">Marfanoid appearance</a>. Others simply claim he had <a href="Marfan%20syndrome">Marfan syndrome</a>, based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible <a href="aortic%20regurgitation">aortic regurgitation</a>, which can cause bobbing of the head (<a href="De%20Musset%27s%20sign">DeMusset's sign</a>) – based on blurring of Lincoln's head in photographs, which back then had a long exposure time. , DNA analysis was being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia.

In <a href="historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents</a> conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one. A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, are occasionally reversed.

President Lincoln's assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability. Historians have said he was "a classical liberal" in the 19th century sense. <a href="Allen%20C.%20Guelzo">Allen C. Guelzo</a> states that Lincoln was a
Lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across Europe and Latin America and even in Asia.

Schwartz argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a> (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a> on the <a href="National%20Mall">National Mall</a> in Washington, D.C. In the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.

By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">political conservatives</a> for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of <a href="John%20Locke">Lockean</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Burkean</a> principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the <a href="Jacksonian%20Democracy">agrarian Democrats</a>. William C. Harris found that Lincoln's "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism". James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform". Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders."

By the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals led by <a href="Lerone%20Bennett%20Jr.">Lerone Bennett Jr.</a>, rejected Lincoln's role as the Great Emancipator. Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed <a href="American%20Colonization%20Society">sending freed slaves</a> to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule" in the late 20th century. On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of <a href="negative%20capability">negative capability</a>, defined by the poet <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a> and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason". In the 21st century, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using Lincoln's Bible for his swearing in to office at both his inaugurations.

Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.

The Union nationalism as envisioned by Lincoln, "helped lead America to the nationalism of <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, and <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>."

Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of <a href="United%20States%20currency">United States currency</a>, the <a href="Penny%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">penny</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20five-dollar%20bill">$5 bill</a>. His likeness also appears on many <a href="U.S.%20presidents%20on%20U.S.%20postage%20stamps%23Abraham%20Lincoln">postage stamps</a> and he has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Nebraska">capital</a> of Nebraska. While he is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old <a href="Grace%20Bedell">Grace Bedell</a>.

The most famous and most visited memorials are Lincoln's sculpture on <a href="Mount%20Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a>; <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a>, <a href="Ford%27s%20Theatre">Ford's Theatre</a>, and <a href="Petersen%20House">Petersen House</a> (where he died) in Washington, D.C.; and the <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum">Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum</a> in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a>, not far from <a href="Lincoln%20Home%20National%20Historic%20Site">Lincoln's home</a>, as well as <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Tomb">his tomb</a>.
There was also the <a href="Great%20Moments%20with%20Mr.%20Lincoln">Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln</a> exhibit in <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a>, and <a href="Hall%20of%20Presidents">Hall of Presidents</a> at <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a>, which had to do with <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> admiring Lincoln since childhood.

Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life". During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, he argues, Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?" However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness". He suggested that <a href="postmodernism">postmodernism</a> and <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a> have diluted greatness as a concept.

The <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name.

Aristotle

Aristotle (; "Aristotélēs", ; 384–322 BC) was an <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> and scientist born in the city of <a href="Stagira%20%28ancient%20city%29">Stagira</a>, <a href="Chalkidiki">Chalkidiki</a>, in the north of <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical Greece</a>. Along with <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, he is considered the "Father of Western Philosophy". Aristotle provided a complex and harmonious synthesis of the various existing philosophies prior to him, including those of Socrates and Plato, and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its fundamental intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be central to the contemporary philosophical discussion.

Little is known for certain about his life. His father, <a href="Nicomachus%20%28father%20of%20Aristotle%29">Nicomachus</a>, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined <a href="Plato%27s%20Academy">Plato's Academy</a> in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (<a href="Circa">c.</a> 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects – including <a href="Physics%20%28Aristotle%29">physics</a>, <a href="biology">biology</a>, <a href="zoology">zoology</a>, <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, <a href="logic">logic</a>, ethics, <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, <a href="Poetics%20%28Aristotle%29">poetry</a>, theatre, music, <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a>, <a href="economics">economics</a>, <a href="politics">politics</a> and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of <a href="Western%20philosophy">Western philosophy</a>. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>, tutored <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> beginning in 343 BC. Teaching Alexander gave Aristotle many opportunities. He established a library in the <a href="Lyceum%20%28Classical%29">Lyceum</a> which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books, which were <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a> <a href="scrolls">scrolls</a>. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of <a href="Platonism">Platonism</a>, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a>. He believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on <a href="perception">perception</a>. Aristotle's views on <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a>s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.

Aristotle's views on <a href="Aristotelian%20physics">physical science</a> profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from <a href="Late%20Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a> and the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a> into the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and were not replaced systematically until <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">the Enlightenment</a> and theories such as <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical mechanics</a>. Some of Aristotle's <a href="zoology">zoological</a> observations, such as on the <a href="Hectocotylus">hectocotyl (reproductive) arm</a> of the <a href="octopus">octopus</a>, were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as <a href="Peter%20Abelard">Peter Abelard</a> and <a href="John%20Buridan">John Buridan</a>. <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelianism</a> profoundly influenced <a href="Judeo-Islamic%20philosophies%20%28800%E2%80%931400%29">Islamic thought</a> during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, as well as <a href="Christian%20theology">Christian theology</a>, especially the <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a> of the <a href="Early%20Church">Early Church</a> and the <a href="Scholasticism">scholastic</a> tradition of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of <a href="virtue%20ethics">virtue ethics</a>.

All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of academic study. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> and <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>. <a href="Early%20Modern">Early Modern</a> theories including <a href="William%20Harvey">William Harvey</a>'s <a href="circulation%20of%20the%20blood">circulation of the blood</a> and <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>'s <a href="kinematics">kinematics</a> were developed in reaction to Aristotle's. In the 19th century, <a href="George%20Boole">George Boole</a> gave Aristotle's logic a mathematical foundation with his system of <a href="Boolean%20algebra">algebraic logic</a>. In the 20th century, <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a> created a new interpretation of Aristotle's political philosophy, but elsewhere Aristotle was widely criticised, even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> and the biologist <a href="Peter%20Medawar">Peter Medawar</a>. More recently, Aristotle has again been taken seriously, such as in the thinking of <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a> and <a href="Alasdair%20MacIntyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a>, while <a href="Armand%20Marie%20Leroi">Armand Marie Leroi</a> has reconstructed <a href="Aristotle%27s%20biology">Aristotle's biology</a>. The image of Aristotle tutoring the young Alexander remains current, and the "Poetics" continues to play a role in the <a href="cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">cinema of the United States</a>.

In general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.

Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose" in Ancient Greek, was born in 384 BC in <a href="Stagira%20%28ancient%20city%29">Stagira</a>, <a href="Chalcidice">Chalcidice</a>, about 55 km (34 miles) east of modern-day <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>. His father <a href="Nicomachus%20%28father%20of%20Aristotle%29">Nicomachus</a> was the personal physician to <a href="Amyntas%20III%20of%20Macedon">King Amyntas of Macedon</a>. Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and <a href="Proxenus%20of%20Atarneus">Proxenus of Atarneus</a> became his guardian. Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29%23Kingship%20and%20the%20royal%20court">Macedonian monarchy</a>.

At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at <a href="Platonic%20Academy">Plato's Academy</a>. He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew <a href="Speusippus">Speusippus</a>, although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died. Aristotle then accompanied <a href="Xenocrates">Xenocrates</a> to the court of his friend <a href="Hermias%20of%20Atarneus">Hermias of Atarneus</a> in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> to the island of <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a>, where together they researched the <a href="botany">botany</a> and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married <a href="Pythias">Pythias</a>, either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> to become the tutor to his son <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander</a>.

Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy</a> and <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a>. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and Aristotle's own attitude towards <a href="Persia">Persia</a> was unabashedly <a href="Ethnocentricism">ethnocentric</a>. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be "a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants". By 335 BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the <a href="Lyceum%20%28Classical%29">Lyceum</a>. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with <a href="Herpyllis">Herpyllis</a> of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, <a href="Nicomachus%20%28son%20of%20Aristotle%29">Nicomachus</a>. According to the "<a href="Suda">Suda</a>", he also had an "<a href="eromenos">erômenos</a>", <a href="Palaephatus">Palaephatus of Abydus</a>.

This period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in <a href="treatise">treatise</a> form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include "<a href="Physics%20%28Aristotle%29">Physics</a>", "<a href="Metaphysics%20%28Aristotle%29">Metaphysics</a>", "<a href="Nicomachean%20Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a>", "<a href="Politics%20%28Aristotle%29">Politics</a>", "<a href="On%20the%20Soul">On the Soul</a>" and "<a href="Poetics%20%28Aristotle%29">Poetics</a>". Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to "logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre."

Near the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an <a href="Hagnothemis">unlikely claim</a> made some six years after the death. Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322 BC, Demophilus and <a href="Eurymedon%20the%20Hierophant">Eurymedon the Hierophant</a> reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in <a href="Chalcis">Chalcis, on Euboea</a>, at which occasion he was said to have stated: "I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy" – a reference to Athens's <a href="Trial%20of%20Socrates">trial and execution of Socrates</a>. He died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year, having named his student <a href="Antipater">Antipater</a> as his chief <a href="executor">executor</a> and leaving a <a href="Will%20%28law%29">will</a> in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.

With the "<a href="Prior%20Analytics">Prior Analytics</a>", Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in <a href="mathematical%20logic">mathematical logic</a>. <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a> stated in the "<a href="Critique%20of%20Pure%20Reason">Critique of Pure Reason</a>" that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.

What we today call "Aristotelian logic" with its <a href="Syllogism%23Types">types of syllogism</a> (methods of logical argument), Aristotle himself would have labelled "analytics". The term "logic" he reserved to mean "dialectics". Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the "<a href="Organon">Organon</a>" around 40 BC by <a href="Andronicus%20of%20Rhodes">Andronicus of Rhodes</a> or others among his followers. The books are:


The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the "Categories," the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in "On Interpretation", to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the "Analytics") and dialectics (in the "Topics" and "Sophistical Refutations"). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory "stricto sensu": the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The "Rhetoric" is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the "Topics".

Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the <a href="Universality%20%28philosophy%29">universal</a>. Aristotle's <a href="ontology">ontology</a> places the universal ("katholou") in <a href="particular">particular</a>s ("kath' hekaston"), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. This means that Aristotle's <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a> is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal <a href="Theory%20of%20Forms">Forms</a> (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, "form" is still what <a href="phenomena">phenomena</a> are based on, but is "instantiated" in a particular substance. Aristotle uses <a href="Inductive%20reasoning">induction</a> from examples alongside <a href="Deductive%20reasoning">deduction</a>, whereas Plato relies on deduction from "<a href="A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">a priori</a>" principles.

In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science". Note, however, that his use of the term "science" carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "scientific method". For Aristotle, "all science ("dianoia") is either practical, poetical or theoretical" ("Metaphysics" 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.

Aristotle coined the term "metaphysics". He also called it "first philosophy", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative ("theoretikē") philosophy which is "theological" and studies the divine. He wrote in his "Metaphysics" (1026a16):

Aristotle examines the concepts of <a href="Substance%20theory">substance</a> ("ousia") and <a href="essence">essence</a> ("to ti ên einai", "the what it was to be") in his "Metaphysics" (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called <a href="hylomorphism">hylomorphism</a>. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the <a href="Material%20substratum">substratum</a>, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the "potential" house, while the form of the substance is the "actual" house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other <a href="Genus-differentia%20definition">differentia</a> that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.

With regard to the change ("<a href="Potentiality%20and%20actuality">kinesis</a>") and its causes now, as he defines in his "<a href="Physics%20%28Aristotle%29">Physics</a>" and "<a href="On%20Generation%20and%20Corruption">On Generation and Corruption</a>" 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ("<a href="Dunamis">dynamis</a>") and actuality ("<a href="entelecheia">entelecheia</a>") in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ("dynamei") plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' ("poiein") or 'be acted upon' ("paschein"), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end ("telos") is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.

For that for the sake of which ("to hou heneka") a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.

In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a <a href="final%20cause">final cause</a> or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"? Since, according to <a href="Plato">Plato</a> there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.

Plato argued that all things have a <a href="Theory%20of%20forms">universal form</a>, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.

Aristotle's "natural philosophy" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences.

In his "<a href="On%20Generation%20and%20Corruption">On Generation and Corruption</a>", Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by <a href="Empedocles">Empedocles</a>, <a href="Earth%20%28classical%20element%29">Earth</a>, <a href="Water%20%28classical%20element%29">Water</a>, <a href="Air%20%28classical%20element%29">Air</a>, and <a href="Fire%20%28classical%20element%29">Fire</a>, to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly <a href="Aether%20%28classical%20element%29">Aether</a>, the divine substance of the <a href="Celestial%20spheres">heavenly spheres</a>, stars and planets.

Aristotle describes two kinds of motion: "violent" or "unnatural motion", such as that of a thrown stone, in the "Physics" (254b10), and "natural motion", such as of a falling object, in "On the Heavens" (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also; in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest, since Aristotle does not address <a href="friction">friction</a>. With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster. This would imply the equation

incorrect in modern physics.

Natural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens, while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.

In the "Physics" (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density, ρ, of the fluid in which it is falling:

Aristotle implies that in a <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a> the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible. Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws. Henri Carteron held the "extreme view" that Aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative, but other authors reject this.

<a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> corrected Aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they <a href="Archimedes%27%20principle">displace enough water</a>; floating depends in Archimedes' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not as Aristotle thought its elementary composition.

Aristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the <a href="Early%20Modern">Early Modern</a> period. <a href="John%20Philoponus">John Philoponus</a> (in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>) and <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo</a> are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect. A contrary opinion is given by <a href="Carlo%20Rovelli">Carlo Rovelli</a>, who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.

Newton's "forced" motion corresponds to Aristotle's "violent" motion with its external agent, but Aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower's hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval <a href="theory%20of%20impetus">theory of impetus</a>.

Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term "aitia" is traditionally translated as "cause", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as "explanation", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.


Aristotle describes experiments in <a href="optics">optics</a> using a <a href="camera%20obscura">camera obscura</a> in "<a href="Problems%20%28Aristotle%29">Problems</a>", book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small <a href="aperture">aperture</a> that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun's image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.

According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of <a href="Accident%20%28philosophy%29">accidental things</a>, "from what is spontaneous". There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that only applies to people's moral choices.

In <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, Aristotle refuted <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a>'s claim that the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out correctly that if "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them."

Aristotle was one of the first people to record any <a href="geology">geological</a> observations. He stated that <a href="Uniformitarianism">geological change</a> was too slow to be observed in one person's lifetime.
The geologist <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a> noted that Aristotle described such change, including "lakes that had dried up" and "deserts that had become watered by rivers", giving as examples the growth of the <a href="Nile%20delta">Nile delta</a> since the time of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, and "the upheaving of one of the <a href="Aeolian%20islands">Aeolian islands</a>, previous to a <a href="volcanic%20eruption">volcanic eruption</a>."'

Aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically, and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a> and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos. His data in "<a href="History%20of%20Animals">History of Animals</a>", "<a href="Generation%20of%20Animals">Generation of Animals</a>", "<a href="Movement%20of%20Animals">Movement of Animals</a>", and "<a href="Parts%20of%20Animals">Parts of Animals</a>" are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas. His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on <a href="botany">botany</a> have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.

Aristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the <a href="catfish">catfish</a>, <a href="electric%20ray">electric ray</a>, and <a href="frogfish">frogfish</a> in detail, as well as <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s such as the <a href="octopus">octopus</a> and <a href="paper%20nautilus">paper nautilus</a>. His description of the <a href="hectocotylus">hectocotyl arm</a> of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s, and of the <a href="Ovoviviparity">ovoviviparous</a> embryological development of the <a href="hound%20shark">hound shark</a>.

He notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the <a href="heron">heron</a>, which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas <a href="duck">duck</a>s that swim have short legs and webbed feet. <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a>, too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>. Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or <a href="Hybridisation%20%28biology%29">hybridisations</a> could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a "survival of the fittest" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results. To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a <a href="common%20descent">common ancestor</a>, or that one kind can <a href="speciation">change into another</a>, or that kinds can become <a href="extinction">extinct</a>.

Aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense. He used the ancient Greek term "pepeiramenoi" to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection. In "Generation of Animals", he finds a fertilised hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.

Instead, he practised a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as <a href="genomics">genomics</a>. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.

From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of <a href="biological%20rules">rules</a> relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. <a href="Life%20expectancy">Lifespan</a> increases with <a href="gestation%20period">gestation period</a>, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, <a href="fecundity">fecundity</a> decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.

Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of <a href="animal">animal</a>s, arranging these in the "History of Animals" in a graded scale of perfection, a "<a href="scala%20naturae">scala naturae</a>", with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave <a href="viviparity">live birth</a> to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above <a href="plant">plant</a>s, and these in turn were above minerals. He grouped what the modern zoologist would call <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s as the hotter "animals with blood", and below them the colder <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s as "animals without blood". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing (<a href="mammal">mammal</a>s), and the egg-laying (<a href="bird">bird</a>s, <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, <a href="fish">fish</a>). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled – cephalopods, and <a href="crustacea">shelled</a>) and the hard-shelled <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s (<a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s and <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a>s). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a <a href="placenta">placenta</a> like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle, is <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this <a href="teleological">teleological</a> view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.

Aristotle's <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, given in his treatise "<a href="On%20the%20Soul">On the Soul</a>" ("peri psyche"), posits three kinds of <a href="soul">soul</a> ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the "<a href="Nous%23Aristotle">nous</a>" (intellect) and "logos" (reason).

For Aristotle, the soul is the <a href="Hylomorphism%23Body%E2%80%93soul%20hylomorphism">form</a> of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement). In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of <a href="Alcmaeon%20of%20Croton">Alcmaeon</a>.

According to Aristotle in "On the Soul", memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal "appearance" and an occurrence in the past. In other words, a memory is a mental picture (<a href="wikt%3Aphantasm">phantasm</a>) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when <a href="stimulus%20%28psychology%29">stimuli</a> such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian '<a href="common%20sense">common sense</a>', and thinking.

Aristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.

Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself. Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of "images" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed. Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression. Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.

Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, described in his <a href="Laws%20of%20Association">Laws of Association</a>. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.

Aristotle describes sleep in "On Sleep and Wakefulness". Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently, unless they are weary.

Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner. Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored. However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience. During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person. This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.

One component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences. Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.

Aristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.

Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the "<a href="Nicomachean%20Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a>".

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ("ergon") of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the "<a href="De%20Anima">psuchē</a>" ("soul") in accordance with reason ("<a href="logos">logos</a>"). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, "<a href="eudaimonia">eudaimonia</a>", generally translated as "happiness" or sometimes "well being". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ("ēthikē" "<a href="arete%20%28moral%20virtue%29">aretē</a>"), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.

Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ("<a href="phronesis">phronesis</a>") and their intellect ("<a href="nous">nous</a>") can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.

In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled "<a href="Politics%20%28Aristotle%29">Politics</a>". Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part". He also famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality. Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.

The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city ("<a href="polis">polis</a>") which functions as a political "community" or "partnership" ("koinōnia"). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together." This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with <a href="social%20contract">social contract</a> theory, according to which individuals leave the <a href="state%20of%20nature">state of nature</a> because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."

In "<a href="Protrepticus%20%28Aristotle%29">Protrepticus</a>", the character 'Aristotle' states:

Aristotle made substantial contributions to <a href="economics">economic thought</a>, especially to thought in the Middle Ages. In "<a href="Politics%20%28Aristotle%29">Politics</a>", Aristotle addresses the city, <a href="property">property</a>, and <a href="trade">trade</a>. His response to criticisms of <a href="private%20property">private property</a>, in <a href="Lionel%20Robbins">Lionel Robbins</a>'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall <a href="utility">utility</a> of social arrangements. Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from <a href="human%20nature">human nature</a>. In "Politics", Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of <a href="money">money</a>. Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or <a href="silver">silver</a>.

Aristotle's discussions on <a href="retail">retail</a> and <a href="interest">interest</a> was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a <a href="profit%20%28economics%29">profit</a>. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.

Aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them "commensurable". He goes to on state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, "if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it".

Aristotle's "Rhetoric" proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: "<a href="ethos">ethos</a>" (an appeal to the speaker's character), "<a href="pathos">pathos</a>" (an appeal to the audience's emotion), and "<a href="logos">logos</a>" (an appeal to logical reasoning). He also categorises rhetoric into three genres: <a href="epideictic">epideictic</a> (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), <a href="Forensic%20rhetoric">forensic</a> (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and <a href="Deliberative%20rhetoric">deliberative</a> (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue). Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical <a href="Proof%20%28truth%29">proofs</a>: "<a href="enthymeme">enthymeme</a>" (proof by <a href="syllogism">syllogism</a>) and "<a href="paradeigma">paradeigma</a>" (proof by example).

Aristotle writes in his "Poetics" that <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poetry</a>, tragedy, comedy, <a href="Dithyramb">dithyrambic poetry</a>, painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of "<a href="mimesis">mimesis</a>" ("imitation"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. He applies the term "mimesis" both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention and contends that the audience's realisation of the "mimesis" is vital to understanding the work itself. Aristotle states that "mimesis" is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry "follows the pattern of nature". Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what <a href="Stephen%20Halliwell%20%28academic%29">Stephen Halliwell</a> calls "highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes." For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.

While it is believed that Aristotle's "Poetics" originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the <a href="catharsis">catharsis</a> of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes "Poetics" with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic. Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the <a href="Pythia">Delphic Oracle</a> and studied the fables of <a href="Aesop">Aesop</a>.

Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, proponents of <a href="feminist%20metaphysics">feminist metaphysics</a> have accused Aristotle of <a href="misogyny">misogyny</a> and <a href="sexism">sexism</a>. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his "Rhetoric" that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.

More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher <a href="Bryan%20Magee">Bryan Magee</a>, "it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of <a href="formal%20logic">formal logic</a>, pioneered the study of <a href="zoology">zoology</a>, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Taneli Kukkonen, writing in "The Classical Tradition", observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing "every branch of intellectual enterprise" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today "will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind." <a href="Jonathan%20Barnes">Jonathan Barnes</a> wrote that "an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought".

Aristotle's pupil and successor, <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a>, wrote the "<a href="Historia%20Plantarum%20%28Theophrastus%29">History of Plants</a>", a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as <a href="carpel">carpel</a> from "carpos", fruit, and <a href="pericarp">pericarp</a>, from "pericarpion", seed chamber.
Theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned.

The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic school</a>. Aristotle's notable students included <a href="Aristoxenus">Aristoxenus</a>, <a href="Dicaearchus">Dicaearchus</a>, <a href="Demetrius%20of%20Phalerum">Demetrius of Phalerum</a>, <a href="Eudemos%20of%20Rhodes">Eudemos of Rhodes</a>, <a href="Harpalus">Harpalus</a>, <a href="Hephaestion">Hephaestion</a>, <a href="Mnason%20of%20Phocis">Mnason of Phocis</a>, <a href="Nicomachus%20%28son%20of%20Aristotle%29">Nicomachus</a>, and Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?"

After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is not until the age of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> under the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemies</a> that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria, <a href="Herophilos">Herophilus of Chalcedon</a>, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between <a href="vein">vein</a>s and <a href="artery">arteries</a>, noting that the latter <a href="pulse">pulse</a> while the former do not. Though a few ancient <a href="atomism">atomists</a> such as <a href="Lucretius">Lucretius</a> challenged the <a href="teleology">teleological</a> viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. <a href="Ernst%20Mayr">Ernst Mayr</a> states that there was "nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance."

Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and <a href="Stephen%20of%20Alexandria">Stephen of Alexandria</a> in the early seventh century. <a href="John%20Philoponus">John Philoponus</a> stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought. Philoponus questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the <a href="theory%20of%20impetus">theory of impetus</a> to explain his observations.

After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and <a href="Michael%20of%20Ephesus">Michael of Ephesus</a> reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by <a href="Anna%20Comnena">Anna Comnena</a>.

Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early <a href="Islamic%20theology">Islamic theology</a>. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle, as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. <a href="Averroes">Averroes</a>, <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> and <a href="Alpharabius">Alpharabius</a>, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. <a href="Alkindus">Alkindus</a> considered Aristotle the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the "exemplar" for all future philosophers. Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the "First Teacher". The title "teacher" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a>) who were influenced by the tradition of <a href="Islamic%20philosophy">Islamic philosophy</a>.

In accordance with the Greek theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with <a href="Plato">Plato</a> essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.

With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early <a href="medieval">medieval</a> Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the "Organon" made by <a href="Boethius">Boethius</a>. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by <a href="Gerard%20of%20Cremona">Gerard of Cremona</a>, and from the original Greek, such as those by <a href="James%20of%20Venice">James of Venice</a> and <a href="William%20of%20Moerbeke">William of Moerbeke</a>. After the <a href="Scholasticism">Scholastic</a> Thomas Aquinas wrote his "<a href="Summa%20Theologica">Summa Theologica</a>", working from Moerbeke's translations and calling Aristotle "The Philosopher", the demand for Aristotle's writings grew, and the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Boethius, <a href="Peter%20Abelard">Peter Abelard</a>, and <a href="John%20Buridan">John Buridan</a> worked on Aristotelian logic.

The medieval English poet <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Chaucer</a> describes his student as being happy by having

<poem>at his beddes heed
Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,
Of aristotle and his philosophie,</poem>

A <a href="The%20tale%20of%20Phyllis%20and%20Aristotle">cautionary medieval tale</a> held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander to avoid the king's seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her, and allowed her to ride him. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Artists such as <a href="Hans%20Baldung">Hans Baldung</a> produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme.

The Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in "<a href="The%20Divine%20Comedy">The Divine Comedy</a>":

In the <a href="Early%20Modern">Early Modern</a> period, scientists such as <a href="William%20Harvey">William Harvey</a> in England and <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like <a href="Galen">Galen</a>, establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the <a href="circulation%20of%20the%20blood">circulation of the blood</a>, establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought. Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle's physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.

The 19th-century German philosopher <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle. Aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ("natural slaves"), and the natural superiority (virtue, "arete") of others. It was <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a>, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.

The English mathematician <a href="George%20Boole">George Boole</a> fully accepted Aristotle's logic, but decided "to go under, over, and beyond" it with his system of <a href="Boolean%20algebra">algebraic logic</a> in his 1854 book "<a href="The%20Laws%20of%20Thought">The Laws of Thought</a>". This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check <a href="Validity%20%28logic%29">validity</a>, and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.

During the 20th century, Aristotle's work was widely criticised. The philosopher <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>
argued that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine". Russell called Aristotle's ethics "repulsive", and labelled his logic "as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy". Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors. In 1985, the biologist <a href="Peter%20Medawar">Peter Medawar</a> could still state in "pure seventeenth century" tones that Aristotle had assembled "a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility".

By the start of the 21st century, however, Aristotle was taken more seriously: Kukkonen noted that "In the best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition." <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a> accredited Aristotle as "the greatest philosopher in history" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently, <a href="Alasdair%20MacIntyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a> has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans. Kukkonen observed, too, that "that most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander" remained current, as in the 2004 film "<a href="Alexander%20%282004%20film%29">Alexander</a>", while the "firm rules" of Aristotle's theory of drama have ensured a role for the "Poetics" in <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>.

Biologists continue to be interested in Aristotle's thinking. <a href="Armand%20Marie%20Leroi">Armand Marie Leroi</a> has reconstructed Aristotle's biology, while <a href="Tinbergen%27s%20four%20questions">Niko Tinbergen's four questions</a>, based on Aristotle's four causes, are used to analyse <a href="animal%20behaviour">animal behaviour</a>; they examine <a href="function%20%28biology%29">function</a>, <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a>, <a href="mechanism%20%28biology%29">mechanism</a>, and <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a>.

The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organisation of <a href="Immanuel%20Bekker">Immanuel Bekker</a>'s Royal Prussian Academy edition ("Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica", Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.

Aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era. His writings are divisible into two groups: the "<a href="exoteric">exoteric</a>", intended for the public, and the "<a href="esoteric">esoteric</a>", for use within the <a href="Lyceum_%28Classical%29">Lyceum</a> school. Aristotle's "lost" works stray considerably in characterisation from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication. <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>'s description of Aristotle's literary style as "a river of gold" must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes. A major question in the history of Aristotle's works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones we now possess came to us. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.

Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a>, <a href="Justus%20van%20Gent">Justus van Gent</a>, <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Paolo Veronese</a>, <a href="Jusepe%20de%20Ribera">Jusepe de Ribera</a>, <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>, and <a href="Francesco%20Hayez">Francesco Hayez</a> over the centuries.

Rembrandt's "<a href="Aristotle%20with%20a%20Bust%20of%20Homer">Aristotle with a Bust of Homer</a>", too, is a celebrated work, showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age: as the art critic <a href="Jonathan%20Jones%20%28journalist%29">Jonathan Jones</a> writes, "this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world, ensnaring us in its musty, glowing, pitch-black, terrible knowledge of time."

The <a href="Aristotle%20Mountains">Aristotle Mountains</a> in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> are named after Aristotle. He was the first person known to conjecture, in his book "<a href="Meteorology%20%28Aristotle%29">Meteorology</a>", the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and called it "Antarctica". <a href="Aristoteles%20%28crater%29">Aristoteles</a> is a crater on the Moon bearing the classical form of Aristotle's name.

An American in Paris

An American in Paris is a <a href="jazz">jazz</a>-influenced orchestral piece by the American composer <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>, written in 1928. Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s and is one of his best-known compositions.

Gershwin composed "An American in Paris" on commission from the conductor <a href="Walter%20Damrosch">Walter Damrosch</a>. He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the <a href="symphony%20orchestra">symphony orchestra</a> plus <a href="celesta">celesta</a>, <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a>s, and automobile horns. He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928, in <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>, with Damrosch conducting the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a>. Gershwin completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.

Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer <a href="Deems%20Taylor">Deems Taylor</a>, noting that: "My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere." When the tone poem moves into the <a href="blues">blues</a>, "our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of <a href="homesickness">homesickness</a>." But, "nostalgia is not a fatal disease." The American visitor "once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life" and "the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant."

Gershwin was attracted by <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>'s unusual chords. Upon Gershwin's request, Ravel accepted him as a student, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study. After his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, Ravel said he couldn't teach him but he would send a letter referring him to <a href="Nadia%20Boulanger">Nadia Boulanger</a>. While the studies were cut short, that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of An American in Paris written as a 'thank you note' to Gershwin's hosts, Robert and Mabel Shirmer. Gershwin called it "a rhapsodic ballet"; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works.

Gershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to the United States for a tour. To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel's friend <a href="E.%20Robert%20Schmitz">Robert Schmitz</a>, a pianist Ravel had met during the War, to urge Ravel to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica, promoting Franco-American musical relations, and was able to offer Ravel a $12,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel. 
Gershwin greeted Ravel in New York in February 1928 at the start of Ravel's U.S. Tour, and joined Ravel again later in the tour in Los Angeles. After a lunch together with <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Chaplin</a> in Beverly Hills, Ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled 'house concert' in a friend's music salon, performing among kindred spirits.

Ravel's tour reignited Gershwin's desire to return to Paris which he did in March 1928. Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris. Yet after playing for her, she told him she could not teach him. Nadia Boulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students: "Don't copy others; be yourself." In this case, "Why try to be a second rate Ravel when you are already a first rate Gershwin?" This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his "<a href="Rhapsody%20in%20Blue">Rhapsody in Blue</a>". Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers, among them <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>; and artist <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>.

Gershwin based "An American in Paris" on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. He described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in "<a href="Musical%20America">Musical America</a>", "My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere."

The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose <a href="Ternary%20form">ABA format</a>. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main "walking" themes in the "Allegretto grazioso" and develops a third theme in the "Subito con brio". The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a> and <a href="Les%20Six">Les Six</a>. This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's "Andante ma con ritmo deciso" introduces the American <a href="Blues">Blues</a> and spasms of homesickness. The "Allegro" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster <a href="twelve-bar%20blues">twelve-bar blues</a>. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. "Moderato con grazia" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the "walking" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “Grandioso.”

"An American in Paris" is scored for 3 <a href="flute">flute</a>s (3rd doubling on <a href="piccolo">piccolo</a>), 2 <a href="oboe">oboe</a>s, <a href="English%20horn">English horn</a>, 2 <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>s in <a href="soprano%20clarinet">B-flat</a>, <a href="bass%20clarinet">bass clarinet</a> in B-flat, 2 <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>s, 4 <a href="French%20horn">horn</a>s in F, 3 <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s in B-flat, 3 <a href="trombone">trombone</a>s, <a href="tuba">tuba</a>, <a href="timpani">timpani</a>, <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a>, <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>, <a href="Triangle%20%28musical%20instrument%29">triangle</a>, <a href="wood%20block">wood block</a>, <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>s, low and high <a href="Tom-tom%20drum">tom-tom</a>s, <a href="xylophone">xylophone</a>, <a href="glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a>, <a href="celesta">celesta</a>, 4 <a href="vehicle%20horn">taxi horns</a> labeled as A, B, C and D with circles around them, <a href="alto%20saxophone">alto saxophone</a>/<a href="soprano%20saxophone">soprano saxophone</a>, <a href="tenor%20saxophone">tenor saxophone</a>/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, <a href="baritone%20saxophone">baritone saxophone</a>/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and <a href="String%20section">strings</a>. Although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes A, B, C and D, it has recently come to light that Gershwin's intention was to have used the notes A, B, D, and A. It is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as A, B, C and D with circles, he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played.

The revised edition by F. Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments. In 2000, Gershwin specialist <a href="Jack%20Gibbons">Jack Gibbons</a> made his own restoration of the original orchestration of An American in Paris, working directly from Gershwin's original manuscript, including the restoration of Gershwin's soprano saxophone parts removed in F. Campbell-Watson's revision; Gibbons' restored orchestration of An American in Paris was performed at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall on July 9, 2000 by the City of Oxford Orchestra conducted by Levon Parikian

<a href="William%20Merrigan%20Daly">William Daly</a> arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in 1929.

Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of "An American in Paris". He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with "a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses." Critics believed that "An American in Paris" was better crafted than his lukewarm <a href="Concerto%20in%20F%20%28Gershwin%29">Concerto in F</a>. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a>, <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, or <a href="Guillaume%20Lekeu">Guillaume Lekeu</a> on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, "It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds."

On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological <a href="Historical%20editions%20%28music%29">critical edition</a> of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent. It is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin's composition process.

The score to "An American in Paris" is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released. The entire project may take 30 to 40 years to complete, but "An American in Paris" will be an early volume in the series.

Two <a href="urtext%20edition">urtext edition</a>s of the work have been published by the German publisher B-Note Music in 2015. The changes made by Campbell-Watson have been withdrawn in both editions. In the extended urtext, 120 bars of music have been re-integrated. Conductor Walter Damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.

"An American in Paris" has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for <a href="RCA%20Victor">RCA Victor</a> in 1929 with <a href="Nathaniel%20Shilkret">Nathaniel Shilkret</a> conducting the <a href="RCA%20Victor%20Symphony%20Orchestra">RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra</a>, drawn from members of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Orchestra">Philadelphia Orchestra</a>. Gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief <a href="celesta">celesta</a> solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A flat, B flat, a higher C and a lower D. The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which "An American in Paris," also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. <a href="Arthur%20Fiedler">Arthur Fiedler</a> and the <a href="Boston%20Pops%20Orchestra">Boston Pops Orchestra</a> recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a> conducting the <a href="NBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a> recorded the piece for <a href="RCA%20Victor">RCA Victor</a>, one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The <a href="Seattle%20Symphony">Seattle Symphony</a> also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today. <a href="Harry%20James">Harry James</a> released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album "One Night Stand," recorded live at the <a href="Aragon%20Ballroom%20%28Chicago%29">Aragon Ballroom in Chicago</a> (<a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia</a> GL 522 and CL 522).

In 1951, <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> released the musical film "<a href="An%20American%20in%20Paris%20%28film%29">An American in Paris</a>", featuring <a href="Gene%20Kelly">Gene Kelly</a> and <a href="Leslie%20Caron">Leslie Caron</a>. Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by <a href="Vincente%20Minnelli">Vincente Minnelli</a>, featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the "An American in Paris" symphonic poem (arranged for the film by <a href="Johnny%20Green">Johnny Green</a>), costing $500,000.

Academy Awards

The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, are a set of 24 awards for artistic and technical merit in the <a href="film%20industry">film industry</a>, given annually by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> (AMPAS), to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette, officially called the "Academy Award of Merit", although more commonly referred to by its nickname "Oscar". The award was originally sculpted by <a href="George%20Stanley%20%28sculptor%29">George Stanley</a> from a design sketch by <a href="Cedric%20Gibbons">Cedric Gibbons</a>. AMPAS first <a href="1st%20Academy%20Awards">presented it in 1929</a> at a private dinner hosted by <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a> in the <a href="Hollywood%20Roosevelt%20Hotel">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</a>.

The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast on radio in 1930 and televised for the first time in 1953. It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now seen live in more than 200 countries, including being streamed live online. Its equivalents – the <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>s for television, the <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>s for theater, and the <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards.

The <a href="90th%20Academy%20Awards">90th Academy Awards</a> ceremony, honoring the best <a href="2017%20in%20film">films of 2017</a>, was held on 4 March 2018, at the <a href="Dolby%20Theatre">Dolby Theatre</a>, in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. The ceremony was hosted by <a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> and was broadcast on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>. A total of 3,072 Oscars have been awarded from the inception of the award through the <a href="90th%20Academy%20Awards">90th</a>.

The <a href="1st%20Academy%20Awards">first Academy Awards</a> presentation was held on 16 May 1929, at a private dinner function at the <a href="Hollywood%20Roosevelt%20Hotel">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</a> with an audience of about 270 people. The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel. The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($ in dollars). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15 minutes.

Winners were announced to media three months earlier. That was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00 pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until an occasion when the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.

The first Best Actor awarded was <a href="Emil%20Jannings">Emil Jannings</a>, for his performances in "<a href="The%20Last%20Command%20%281928%20film%29">The Last Command</a>" and "<a href="The%20Way%20of%20All%20Flesh%20%281927%20film%29">The Way of All Flesh</a>". He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and <a href="Janet%20Gaynor">Janet Gaynor</a> later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.

At the 29th ceremony, held on 27 March 1957, the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Best Foreign Language Film</a> category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.

The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Feature">Academy Award for Best Animated Feature</a>.

Since 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>.

Traditionally, the previous year's winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, while the previous year's winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.

In addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually):

The Academy also awards <a href="Nicholl%20Fellowships%20in%20Screenwriting">Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting</a>. 

The best known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated <a href="bronze">bronze</a> on a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34.3 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.856 kg), and depicts a knight rendered in <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> style holding a <a href="crusades">crusader's</a> sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.

The model for the statuette is said to be Mexican actor <a href="Emilio%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Emilio "El Indio" Fernández</a>. Sculptor <a href="George%20Stanley%20%28sculptor%29">George Stanley</a> (who also did the Muse Fountain at the <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a>) sculpted <a href="Cedric%20Gibbons">Cedric Gibbons</a>' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of <a href="Britannia%20metal">Britannia metal</a>, a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold. Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the <a href="C.W.%20Shumway%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">C.W. Shumway & Sons</a> Foundry in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Illinois">Batavia, Illinois</a>, which also contributed to casting the molds for the <a href="Vince%20Lombardi%20Trophy">Vince Lombardi Trophy</a> and <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>'s statuettes. From 1983 to 2015, approximately 50 Oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer <a href="R.S.%20Owens%20%26amp%3B%20Company">R.S. Owens & Company</a>. It takes between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes.
In 2016, the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes, handing manufacturing duties to <a href="Walden%2C%20New%20York">Walden, New York</a>-based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry. While based on a digital scan of an original 1929 Oscar, the statuettes retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal. Cast in liquid bronze from <a href="3D-printed">3D-printed</a> ceramic molds and polished, they are then electroplated in 24-karat gold by <a href="Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York">Brooklyn, New York</a>–based Epner Technology. The time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly three months. R.S. Owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the Academy and service existing Oscars that need replating.

The origin of the name "Oscar" is disputed. One biography of <a href="Bette%20Davis">Bette Davis</a>, who was a president of the Academy, claims she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson. Another claimed origin is the Academy's Executive Secretary, <a href="Margaret%20Herrick">Margaret Herrick</a>, first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her "Uncle Oscar" (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce). Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, "Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'." 

One of the earliest mentions of the term "Oscar" dates to a <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a> article about the 1934 <a href="6th%20Academy%20Awards">6th Academy Awards</a>. <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> also thanked the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. The trophy officially received the name "Oscar" in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy, and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.

Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums. In December 2011, <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>' 1941 Oscar for "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>" (<a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Screenplay">Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay</a>) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy. On 20 December 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542.

In 1992, <a href="Harold%20Russell">Harold Russell</a> needed money for his wife's medical expenses. In a controversial decision, he consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for "<a href="The%20Best%20Years%20of%20Our%20Lives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a>" to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions, and on 6 August 1992, in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60,500. Since he won the award before 1950, he was not required to offer it to the Academy first. Russell defended his decision, saying, "I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't." Harold Russell is the only Academy Award-winning actor to ever sell an Oscar.

While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market. <a href="Mike%20Todd">Michael Todd's</a> grandson tried to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989, but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.

Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in mid-January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of over 8,000 .

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm <a href="PricewaterhouseCoopers">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> (and its predecessor <a href="Price%20Waterhouse">Price Waterhouse</a>) for the past 83 annual awards ceremonies. The firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the Academy in December to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in January of the next year, then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours.

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).

In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013.

According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of 1 January to midnight at the end of 31 December, in <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California">Los Angeles County, California</a>, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film, Best Documentary Feature, and Best Documentary Short Subject).

The Best Foreign Language Film award does not require a U.S. release. The Best Documentary Feature award requires week-long releases in "both" Los Angeles County "and" <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> during the previous calendar year.

The Best Documentary Short Subject award has noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering a one-year period starting on 1 September and ending on 31 August of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in "either" Los Angeles County "or" New York City during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of a number of competitive film festivals designated by the Academy. Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in the Documentary category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible.

For example, the 2009 <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a> winner, "<a href="The%20Hurt%20Locker">The Hurt Locker</a>", was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the <a href="81st%20Academy%20Awards">2008 awards</a> as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the <a href="82nd%20Academy%20Awards">2009 awards</a>. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short-subject awards, and it must exist either on a <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm</a> or <a href="70%20mm%20film">70 mm film</a> print or in 24 frame/s or 48 frame/s <a href="progressive%20scan">progressive scan</a> <a href="digital%20cinema">digital cinema</a> format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels. Effective with the <a href="90th%20Academy%20Awards">90th Academy Awards</a>, presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series will be ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of "", an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> and <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, in that category in <a href="89th%20Academy%20Awards">2017</a>. The Academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees. In all major categories, a variant of the <a href="single%20transferable%20vote">single transferable vote</a> is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially. In certain categories, including Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.

In most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by <a href="plurality%20voting">plurality voting</a> of all members. Since 2009, the Best Picture winner has been chosen by <a href="instant%20runoff%20voting">instant runoff voting</a>. Since 2013, re-weighted <a href="range%20voting">range voting</a> has been used to select the nominees for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Visual%20Effects">Best Visual Effects</a>.

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in <a href="Oscar%20season">Oscar season</a>. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders. For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee "<a href="The%20Hurt%20Locker">The Hurt Locker</a>" was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner ("The Hurt Locker" eventually won).

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. <a href="Black%20tie">Black tie</a> dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a <a href="bow-tie">bow-tie</a>, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)

The Academy Awards is the only awards show televised live in the United States (excluding Hawaii), Canada, and the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world. The Oscars were first televised in <a href="25th%20Academy%20Awards">1953</a> by <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, which continued to broadcast the event until <a href="32nd%20Academy%20Awards">1960</a>, when <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in <a href="38th%20Academy%20Awards">1966</a>) through <a href="42nd%20Academy%20Awards">1970</a>. NBC regained the rights for five years then ABC resumed broadcast duties in <a href="48th%20Academy%20Awards">1976</a> and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028. The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by <a href="56th%20Academy%20Awards">1984</a>, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.

The ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February since <a href="76th%20Academy%20Awards">2004</a> to help disrupt and shorten the intense <a href="For%20Your%20Consideration%20%28advertising%29">lobbying and ad campaigns</a> associated with <a href="Oscar%20season">Oscar season</a> in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">NCAA Basketball Tournament</a>, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In <a href="48th%20Academy%20Awards">1976</a> and <a href="49th%20Academy%20Awards">1977</a>, ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite NBC's NCAA title game.) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February <a href="sweeps">sweeps</a> period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into first Sunday of March in order to avoid clash with the <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">Winter Olympic Games</a>. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of <a href="Passover">Passover</a> and <a href="Easter">Easter</a>, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The production of the Academy Awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most <a href="Emmy%20Awards">Emmys</a> in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations overall since that award's own launch in <a href="21st%20Academy%20Awards">1949</a>.

After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern</a>/6:00 p.m <a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">Pacific</a>, since the <a href="71st%20Academy%20Awards">1999 ceremonies</a>, it was moved to Sundays at 8:30 pm ET/5:30 pm PT. The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier. For many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office. In 2010, the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Furthermore, a January ceremony on Sunday would clash with <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> playoff games.

Originally scheduled for 8 April 1968, the <a href="40th%20Academy%20Awards">40th Academy Awards</a> ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the <a href="Assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">assassination</a> of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>. On 30 March 1981, the <a href="53rd%20Academy%20Awards">53rd Academy Awards</a> was postponed for one day, after <a href="Attempted%20assassination%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">the shooting</a> of President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and others in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>

In 1993, an "In Memoriam" segment was introduced, honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members. This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a "<a href="popularity%20contest">popularity contest</a>" feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15 minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes. In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced winners' <a href="Oscar%20speech">acceptance speeches</a> must not run past 45 seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed "the single most hated thing on the show" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion. In 2016, in a further effort to streamline speeches, winners' dedications were displayed on an on-screen <a href="news%20ticker">ticker</a>. During the 2018 ceremony, host <a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> acknowledged how long the ceremony had become, by announcing that he would give a brand-new <a href="jet%20ski">jet ski</a> to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night (a reward won by <a href="Mark%20Bridges%20%28costume%20designer%29">Mark Bridges</a> when accepting his <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Costume%20Design">Best Costume Design</a> award for "<a href="Phantom%20Thread">Phantom Thread</a>").

Although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards have steadily dropped; the <a href="88th%20Academy%20Awards">88th Academy Awards</a> were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18-49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions. In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes, nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.

Historically, the "Oscarcast" has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the <a href="70th%20Academy%20Awards">70th Academy Awards</a> in 1998, the year of "<a href="Titanic%20%281997%20film%29">Titanic</a>", which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars. The <a href="76th%20Academy%20Awards">76th Academy Awards</a> ceremony in which "" (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers. The most watched ceremony based on <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> to date, however, was the <a href="42nd%20Academy%20Awards">42nd Academy Awards</a> (Best Picture "<a href="Midnight%20Cowboy">Midnight Cowboy</a>") which drew a 43.4% household rating on 7 April 1970.

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The <a href="78th%20Academy%20Awards">78th Academy Awards</a> which awarded low-budgeted, independent film "<a href="Crash%20%282004%20film%29">Crash</a>" (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%. In 2008, the <a href="80th%20Academy%20Awards">80th Academy Awards</a> telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards. The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film ("<a href="No%20Country%20for%20Old%20Men%20%28film%29">No Country for Old Men</a>").

In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the <a href="Hollywood%20Roosevelt%20Hotel">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</a>. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the <a href="Ambassador%20Hotel%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Ambassador Hotel</a> on <a href="Wilshire%20Boulevard">Wilshire Boulevard</a> and the <a href="Millennium%20Biltmore%20Hotel">Biltmore Hotel</a> in downtown Los Angeles.

<a href="Grauman%27s%20Chinese%20Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a> in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the <a href="Shrine%20Auditorium">Shrine Auditorium</a> in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The <a href="21st%20Academy%20Awards">21st Academy Awards</a> in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what was the Academy's headquarters on <a href="Melrose%20Avenue">Melrose Avenue</a> in Hollywood.

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's <a href="Pantages%20Theatre%20%28Hollywood%29">Pantages Theatre</a>. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the <a href="Majestic%20Theatre%20%28Columbus%20Circle%29">NBC International Theatre</a> (1953) and then at the <a href="New%20Century%20Theatre">NBC Century Theatre</a>, after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the <a href="Santa%20Monica%20Civic%20Auditorium">Santa Monica Civic Auditorium</a> in <a href="Santa%20Monica%2C%20California">Santa Monica, California</a> in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time to the <a href="Dorothy%20Chandler%20Pavilion">Dorothy Chandler Pavilion</a> at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Music%20Center">Los Angeles County Music Center</a>.

In 2002, the <a href="Dolby%20Theatre">Dolby Theatre</a> (previously known as the Kodak Theatre) became the presentation's current venue.

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

In August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.

The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories. To date, the following proposed categories have been rejected:

The Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees, rather than by the Academy membership as a whole. They are not always presented on a consistent annual basis.



Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the "<a href="Oscar%20season">Oscar season</a>". This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality. <a href="William%20Friedkin">William Friedkin</a>, an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as "the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself".

Tim Dirks, editor of <a href="American%20Movie%20Classics">AMC's</a> <a href="filmsite.org">filmsite.org</a>, has written of the Academy Awards,

Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies, and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. This has led to the coining of the term '<a href="Oscar%20bait">Oscar bait</a>', describing such movies. This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.

The Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees. This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929 which shows us that only 6.4% of academy award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing. The <a href="88th%20Academy%20Awards">88th awards ceremony</a> became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media by the #OscarsSoWhite, based on critics' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias. In response, the Academy initiated "historic" changes in membership by the year 2020.

Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity or presented as a "career honor" to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.

Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter <a href="Dudley%20Nichols">Dudley Nichols</a> (Best Writing in 1935 for "<a href="The%20Informer%20%281935%20film%29">The Informer</a>"). Nichols boycotted the <a href="8th%20Academy%20Awards">8th Academy Awards</a> ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild. Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.

<a href="George%20C.%20Scott">George C. Scott</a> became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for "<a href="Patton%20%28film%29">Patton</a>") at the <a href="43rd%20Academy%20Awards">43rd Academy Awards</a> ceremony. Scott described it as a "meat parade", saying "I don't want any part of it."

The third person to refuse the award was <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>") citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a>. At the <a href="45th%20Academy%20Awards">45th Academy Awards</a> ceremony, Brando sent actress and <a href="civil%20rights%20activist">civil rights activist</a> <a href="Sacheen%20Littlefeather">Sacheen Littlefeather</a> to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms.

At the 2017 awards ceremony, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly announced that "La La Land" was the Best Picture award recipient, instead of "Moonlight", the actual winner. Beatty had been given the wrong envelope by a partner from PricewaterhouseCoopers, and after hesitating during the announcement, during which PricewaterhouseCoopers failed to correct their error, handed the envelope to Dunaway, which listed Emma Stone as Best Actress for "La La Land" and led to the confusion. The proper winner was announced after the acceptance speeches by "La La Land" producers Jordan Horowitz, Marc Platt and Fred Berger. The following year, Beatty and Dunaway were invited back as announcers for Best Picture winner, and this time they were handed the correct envelope, which PricewaterhouseCoppers accomplished without error.

The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards:

It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In recent years, these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners. The value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. In 2014, the value was reported to be as high as US$80,000. The value has risen to the point where the U.S. <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.
Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant, <a href="videophone">videophone</a>s, a four-night stay at a hotel, watches, bracelets, vacation packages, spa treatments, bottles of vodka, maple salad dressing, and weight-loss gummie candy. Some of the gifts have even had a "risque" element to them; in 2014, the adult products retailer <a href="Adam%20%26amp%3B%20Eve%20%28company%29">Adam & Eve</a> had a "Secret Room Gifting Suite". Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included <a href="Judith%20Hoag">Judith Hoag</a>, <a href="Carolyn%20Hennesy">Carolyn Hennesy</a>, <a href="Kate%20Linder">Kate Linder</a>, <a href="Chris%20Mulkey">Chris Mulkey</a>, <a href="Jim%20O%27Heir">Jim O'Heir</a>, and <a href="NBA">NBA</a> player <a href="John%20Salley">John Salley</a>.

The film has no male actors, with all roles played by females. The film was produced in 1996.

In order to prepare herself to play a role commemorating the life of legendary actress Empar Ribera, young actress (<a href="Merc%C3%A8%20Pons">Mercè Pons</a>) interviews three established actresses who had been the Ribera's pupils: the international diva Glòria Marc (<a href="N%C3%BAria%20Espert">Núria Espert</a>), the television star Assumpta Roca (<a href="Rosa%20Maria%20Sard%C3%A0">Rosa Maria Sardà</a>), and dubbing director Maria Caminal (<a href="Anna%20Lizaran">Anna Lizaran</a>).


"Actrius" screened in 2001 at the <a href="Grauman%27s%20Egyptian%20Theatre">Grauman's Egyptian Theatre</a> in an <a href="American%20Cinematheque">American Cinematheque</a> retrospective of the works of its director. The film had first screened at the same location in 1998. It was also shown at the 1997 <a href="Stockholm%20International%20Film%20Festival">Stockholm International Film Festival</a>.

In "Movie - Film - Review", "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" staffer Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were "competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers", the film "is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident". Noting that there were "occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness", they did not "justify comparisons to "<a href="All%20About%20Eve">All About Eve</a>"", and were "insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with "<a href="Rashomon">Rashomon</a>"". He also wrote that "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" called the film a "slow, stuffy chamber-piece", and that "<a href="The%20Evening%20Standard">The Evening Standard</a>" stated the film's "best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome's composed veneers". <a href="MRQE">MRQE</a> wrote "This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story."

International Atomic Time

International Atomic Time (TAI, from the French name ) is a high-precision atomic <a href="coordinate%20time">coordinate</a> <a href="time%20standard">time standard</a> based on the notional passage of <a href="proper%20time">proper time</a> on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s <a href="geoid">geoid</a>. It is the principal realisation of <a href="Terrestrial%20Time">Terrestrial Time</a> (except for a fixed offset of epoch). It is also the basis for <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a> (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface. , when another <a href="leap%20second">leap second</a> was added, TAI is exactly 37 seconds ahead of UTC. The 37 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972.

TAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both <a href="Julian%20Date">Julian Date</a>s and the <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with <a href="Universal%20Time">Universal Time</a> at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.

TAI is a <a href="weighted%20average">weighted average</a> of the time kept by over 400 <a href="atomic%20clock">atomic clock</a>s in over 50 national laboratories worldwide. The majority of the clocks involved are <a href="caesium%20clock">caesium clock</a>s; the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI) definition of the <a href="second">second</a> is based on <a href="caesium">caesium</a>. The clocks are compared using <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">GPS</a> signals and <a href="two-way%20satellite%20time%20and%20frequency%20transfer">two-way satellite time and frequency transfer</a>. Due to the <a href="signal%20averaging">signal averaging</a> TAI is an <a href="order%20of%20magnitude">order of magnitude</a> more stable than its best constituent clock.

The participating institutions each broadcast, in <a href="real-time%20data">real time</a>, a frequency signal with <a href="timecode">timecode</a>s, which is their estimate of TAI. Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds. These time scales are denoted in the form "UTC(NPL)" in the UTC form, where "NPL" in this case identifies the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%2C%20UK">National Physical Laboratory, UK</a>. The TAI form may be denoted "TAI(NPL)". The latter is not to be confused with "TA(NPL)", which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other. The <a href="International%20Bureau%20of%20Weights%20and%20Measures">International Bureau of Weights and Measures</a> (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible. This combined time scale is published monthly in "Circular T", and is the <a href="Canonical%20form">canonical</a> TAI. This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC("k") (equivalent to TAI-TAI("k")) for each participating institution "k". The same circular also gives tables of TAI-TA("k"), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T. Aside from this, once published in Circular T, the TAI scale is not revised. In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale. Since the published circulars are definitive, better estimates do not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of <a href="Terrestrial%20Time">Terrestrial Time</a> (TT).

Early atomic time scales consisted of <a href="quartz%20clock">quartz clock</a>s with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)</a> and was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the <a href="Royal%20Greenwich%20Observatory">Royal Greenwich Observatory</a>. The <a href="International%20Time%20Bureau">International Time Bureau</a> (BIH) began a time scale, T or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of <a href="VLF">VLF</a> radio signals. The <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Observatory">United States Naval Observatory</a> began the A.1 scale 13 September 1956, using an <a href="Atomichron">Atomichron</a> commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the <a href="National%20Bureau%20of%20Standards">National Bureau of Standards</a>, <a href="Boulder%2C%20Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</a>. Both the BIH scale and A.1 were defined by an <a href="Epoch%20%28reference%20date%29">epoch</a> at the beginning of 1958 The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: "A3" in 1963 and "TA(BIH)" in 1969. This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the <a href="astronomy">astronomical</a> realisation of UT2. At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.

The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 the name International Atomic Time (TAI) was assigned to a time scale based on SI seconds with no leap seconds. During this time, irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected. In 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates, but this was disproven in 1968.

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to <a href="gravitational%20time%20dilation">gravitational time dilation</a>, and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks. Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at <a href="mean%20sea%20level">mean sea level</a> (the geoid). Because the clocks were, on average, well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about one part in a trillion. The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name "EAL" ("Echelle Atomique Libre", meaning "Free Atomic Scale").

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for <a href="Barycentric%20Coordinate%20Time">Barycentric Coordinate Time</a> (TCB), <a href="Geocentric%20Coordinate%20Time">Geocentric Coordinate Time</a> (TCG), and <a href="Terrestrial%20Time">Terrestrial Time</a> (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system. All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant. TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.

The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated "In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC."

UTC is a <a href="discontinuous">discontinuous</a> (i.e. regularly adjusted by leap seconds) time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time. From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971 the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated <a href="UT2">UT2</a>. Afterwards these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate <a href="UT1">UT1</a>. This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale; the post-1971 more linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally. The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as <a href="navigation">navigation</a> which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.

Altruism

Altruism is the <a href="moral%20principle">principle</a> and <a href="moral%20courage">moral practice</a> of concern for <a href="happiness">happiness</a> of other <a href="human%20kind">human beings</a> and/or animals, resulting in a <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a> both <a href="material">material</a> and <a href="spirituality">spiritual</a>. It is a traditional <a href="virtue">virtue</a> in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In Hindu / Sanathana Dharma (whose philosphy is "inclusive", i.e includes, and welcomes everybody), where the dictum "Vasudaiva Kutumbakam" (the world is ONE FAMILY) is in force, always, "others" means "EVERYONE", unconditionally.

In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of <a href="selfishness">selfishness</a>.

In a common way of living, it doesn't deny the singular nature of the subject, but realizes the traits of the individual <a href="personality">personality</a> in relation to the others, with a true, direct and personal <a href="interaction">interaction</a> with each of them. It is focusing both on a single person and the whole <a href="community">community</a>. In a (not only) Christian practice, it is the law of love direct to the ego and his neighbour.

The word "altruism" was coined by the French philosopher <a href="Auguste%20Comte">Auguste Comte</a> in French, as "altruisme", for an <a href="antonym">antonym</a> of <a href="egoism">egoism</a>. He derived it from the Italian "altrui", which in turn was derived from Latin "alteri", meaning "<a href="alterity">other people</a>" or "somebody else".

Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is "intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards".

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of <a href="loyalty">loyalty</a>, in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether ""true"" altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of <a href="psychological%20egoism">psychological egoism</a> suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal <a href="gratification">gratification</a>. The validity of this argument depends on whether <a href="Motivation%23Intrinsic%20and%20extrinsic%20motivation">intrinsic rewards</a> qualify as "benefits".

The term "<a href="altruism%20%28ethics%29">altruism</a>" may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with <a href="ethical%20egoism">egoism</a>, which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first.

The concept has a long history in <a href="Philosophy">philosophical</a> and <a href="Ethics">ethical</a> thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding <a href="sociologist">sociologist</a> and <a href="philosopher%20of%20science">philosopher of science</a>, <a href="Auguste%20Comte">Auguste Comte</a>, and has become a major topic for <a href="psychologists">psychologists</a> (especially <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> researchers), <a href="evolutionary%20biologists">evolutionary biologists</a>, and <a href="ethology">ethologists</a>. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.

<a href="Marcel%20Mauss">Marcel Mauss</a>'s book "The Gift" contains a passage called "Note on alms". This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:

Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.


In the science of <a href="ethology">ethology</a> (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of <a href="social%20evolution">social evolution</a>, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the <a href="fitness%20%28biology%29">fitness</a> of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. In <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, <a href="Tip%20%28gratuity%29">tipping</a>, courtship gifts, production of <a href="public%20good">public good</a>s, and <a href="environmentalism">environmentalism</a>.

Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from <a href="evolutionary%20game%20theory">evolutionary game theory</a> a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are:

Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their <a href="inclusive%20fitness">inclusive fitness</a> when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.

Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.

The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind <a href="George%20R.%20Price">George R. Price</a>'s development of the <a href="Price%20equation">Price equation</a>, which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular <a href="slime%20mould">slime mould</a>s, such as "<a href="Dictyostelid">Dictyostelium</a> mucoroides." These protists live as individual <a href="amoeba">amoeba</a>e until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.

Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.

Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> in his 1902 book "" and <a href="Peter%20Singer">Peter Singer</a> in his book "<a href="A%20Darwinian%20Left">A Darwinian Left</a>."

Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using <a href="functional%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">functional magnetic resonance imaging</a>. In their research, published in the <a href="Proceedings%20of%20the%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> USA in October 2006, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the <a href="Mesolimbic%20pathway">mesolimbic</a> reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/<a href="septal%20region">septal region</a>. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable. One brain region, the subgenual <a href="anterior%20cingulate">anterior cingulate</a> cortex/<a href="basal%20forebrain">basal forebrain</a>, contributes to learning altruistic behavior, especially in those with trait empathy. The same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding.

In fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> neuroscientist <a href="Antonio%20R.%20Damasio">Antonio R. Damasio</a> and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the <a href="ventromedial%20prefrontal%20cortex">ventromedial prefrontal cortex</a> lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that When confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with "end-justifies-the-means" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue - in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city - these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to <a href="Adrian%20Raine">Adrian Raine</a>, a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: "Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?"

In another study, in the 1990s, Dr. Bill Harbaugh, a <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a> economist, concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the study group into two groups: "egoists" and "altruists". One of their discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered "egoists" sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity, such as a person's environment and values.

The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines "psychological altruism" as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare." Psychological altruism is contrasted with "psychological egoism," which refers to the motivation to increase one's own welfare.

There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism. Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors. However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The <a href="social%20exchange%20theory">social exchange theory</a> postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self. <a href="Daniel%20Batson">Daniel Batson</a> is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (<a href="principlism">principlism</a>). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless. The "<a href="empathy-altruism">empathy-altruism</a> hypothesis" basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering. Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.
In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the "<a href="Bystander%20effect">Bystander effect</a>"). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.

Many studies have observed the effects of <a href="volunteering">volunteerism</a> (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>, <a href="anxiety%20%28mood%29">anxiety</a>, and <a href="somatization">somatization</a>. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness. It is important to note that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder. The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional. Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states.

Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness. For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant). Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.".

"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity". American Sociological Association.). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges <a href="Public%20sociology">Public sociology</a> saying, "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and "build the good society". The motivation of altruism is also the focus of study; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims.

<a href="Pathology">Pathological</a> altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good.

The term "pathological altruism" was popularised by the book "<a href="Pathological%20Altruism">Pathological Altruism</a>".

Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.

Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, and <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. "Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" (<a href="Dalai%20Lama">Dalai Lama</a>).

Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (Dalai Lama).

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.

The fundamental principles of <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of "<a href="Ahimsa">Ahimsa</a>" – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first <a href="Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a>, <a href="Rishabhdev">Rishabhdev</a>, introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.

Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
The "great vows" (<a href="Mahavrata">Mahavrata</a>) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" (<a href="Anuvrata">Anuvrata</a>) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.

The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every <a href="Soul%20%28Jainism%29">soul</a> as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become "Siddha" (<a href="God%20in%20Jainism">God in Jainism</a>). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.

Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>, especially in the <a href="Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> and the <a href="Sermon%20on%20the%20Plain">Sermon on the Plain</a>. From biblical to medieval <a href="Christian%20traditions">Christian traditions</a>, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Pauline</a> phrase "love seeks not its own interests." In his book "Indoctrination and Self-deception," Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.

<a href="St%20Thomas%20Aquinas">St Thomas Aquinas</a> interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others. Considering that "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" and quotes Aristotle that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves," he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, <a href="Auguste%20Comte">Comte</a> was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. <a href="Thomas%20Jay%20Oord">Thomas Jay Oord</a> has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.

German philosopher <a href="Max%20Scheler">Max Scheler</a> distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence". Another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business." At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."

In <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, the concept 'ithaar' (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by ALLAH on the human body, considered to be property of ALLAH alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; <a href="Islam">Islam</a> considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for <a href="ALLAH">ALLAH</a> (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like <a href="Rabia%20al-Adawiyya">Rabia al-Adawiyya</a> who paid attention to the difference between dedication to <a href="ALLAH">ALLAH</a> (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet <a href="Yunus%20Emre">Yunus Emre</a> explained this philosophy as "Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü" or "We love the creature, because of The Creator." For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.

Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi <a href="Abraham%20Isaac%20Kook">Abraham Isaac Kook</a> stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity. This is defined as <a href="Tzedakah">bestowal</a>, or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> defines God as the force of giving in <a href="existence">existence</a>. Rabbi <a href="Moshe%20Chaim%20Luzzatto">Moshe Chaim Luzzatto</a> in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi <a href="Yehuda%20Ashlag">Yehuda Ashlag</a>, in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework. Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to <a href="divinity">divinity</a>.

Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, <a href="Guru%20Gobind%20Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a> Ji (the tenth <a href="guru">guru</a> in Sikhism), was in war with the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, <a href="Bhai%20Kanhaiya">Bhai Kanhaiya</a>, attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield."What were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru. "I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru."

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.

In Hinduism Selflessness (Atmatyag), Love (Prema), Kindness (Daya) and Forgiveness (Kshama) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or "Manushyattva". Giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or "Punya" and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or "Paapa" and will led them to heaven or "Swarga" in afterlife. Altruism is also the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs.

<a href="Swami%20Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a>, the legendary Hindu monk, has said -"Jive prem kare jeijon, Seijon sebiche Iswar" (Whoever loves any living being, is serving god.). Mass donation of clothes to poor people (Vastraseva), or blood donation camp or mass food donation (Annaseva) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies.

<a href="Swami%20Sivananda">Swami Sivananda</a>, an <a href="Advaita">Advaita</a> scholar, reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the <a href="Brahma%20Sutras">Brahma Sutras</a>, a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates <a href="apurva">apurva</a> or <a href="Merit%20%28Buddhism%29">punya</a>, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.

However the very well known and popular text, the <a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a> supports the doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) & "nishkaama karma" or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.

There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of <a href="Altruism%20%28ethics%29">ethical altruism</a> maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is <a href="ethical%20egoism">ethical egoism</a>, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with <a href="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>, which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.

A related concept in <a href="descriptive%20ethics">descriptive ethics</a> is <a href="psychological%20egoism">psychological egoism</a>, the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. <a href="Rational%20egoism">Rational egoism</a> is the view that <a href="rationality">rationality</a> consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

The genes <a href="OXTR">OXTR</a>, <a href="CD38">CD38</a>, <a href="COMT">COMT</a>, <a href="DRD4">DRD4</a>, <a href="DRD5">DRD5</a>, <a href="IGF2">IGF2</a>, <a href="GABRB2">GABRB2</a> have been found to be candidate genes for altruism.

Ayn Rand

Ayn Rand (; born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum;  – March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American writer and philosopher. She is known for her two best-selling novels, "<a href="The%20Fountainhead">The Fountainhead</a>" and "<a href="Atlas%20Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a>", and for developing a philosophical system she named <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">Objectivism</a>. Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in 1935 and 1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, "The Fountainhead". In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel "Atlas Shrugged". Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own <a href="Objectivist%20periodicals">periodicals</a> and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.

Rand advocated <a href="reason">reason</a> as the only means of acquiring <a href="knowledge">knowledge</a> and rejected faith and religion. She supported <a href="Rational%20egoism">rational</a> and <a href="ethical%20egoism">ethical egoism</a> and rejected <a href="Altruism%20%28ethics%29">altruism</a>. In politics, she condemned the <a href="initiation%20of%20force">initiation of force</a> as immoral and opposed <a href="collectivism">collectivism</a> and <a href="statism">statism</a> as well as <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>, instead supporting "<a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a>" <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>, which she defined as the system based on recognizing <a href="individual%20rights">individual rights</a>, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted <a href="romantic%20realism">romantic realism</a>. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> and <a href="classical%20liberals">classical liberals</a>.

Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The <a href="Objectivist%20movement">Objectivist movement</a> attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among <a href="Libertarianism">libertarians</a> and <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">American conservatives</a>.

Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum () on February 2, 1905, to a <a href="Russian-Jewish">Russian-Jewish</a> bourgeois family living in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan). Her father was upwardly mobile and a pharmacist and her mother was socially ambitious and religiously observant. Rand later said she found school unchallenging and began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten. At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was <a href="Vladimir%20Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a>'s younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the <a href="Nabokov%20house">Nabokov mansion</a>: while Nabokova defended <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, Rand supported <a href="republicanism">republican ideals</a>.

She was twelve at the time of the <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a> of 1917, during which she favored <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a> over <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Nicholas%20II">Nicholas II</a>. The subsequent <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> and the rule of the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s under <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimean Peninsula</a>, which was initially under control of the <a href="White%20Army">White Army</a> during the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>. While in high school, Rand realized that she was an <a href="atheist">atheist</a> and valued <a href="reason">reason</a> above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.
After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at <a href="Petrograd%20State%20University">Petrograd State University</a>. At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of <a href="social%20pedagogy">social pedagogy</a>, majoring in history. At the university she was introduced to the writings of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively. She also studied the philosophical works of <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>. Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>, <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, <a href="Edmond%20Rostand">Edmond Rostand</a>, and <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, who became her perennial favorites.

Along with many other bourgeois students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, however, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate, which Rand did in October 1924. She then studied for a year at the State <a href="Tekhnikum">Technicum</a> for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment she wrote an essay about the Polish actress <a href="Pola%20Negri">Pola Negri</a>, which became her first published work.

By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be "Rand", possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt of her birth surname in <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> handwriting, and she adopted the first name "Ayn", either from a <a href="Finnish%20language">Finnish</a> name "<a href="Aino%20%28given%20name%29">Aino</a>" or from the <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> word ("<a href="ayin">ayin</a>", meaning "eye").

In late 1925, Rand was granted a <a href="Visa%20%28document%29">visa</a> to visit relatives in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. She departed on January 17, 1926. When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> that she cried what she later called "tears of splendor". Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then left for <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood, California</a>.

In Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> led to work as an <a href="Extra%20%28drama%29">extra</a> in his film "<a href="The%20King%20of%20Kings%20%281927%20film%29">The King of Kings</a>" and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter. While working on "The King of Kings", she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. She became a <a href="Permanent%20residence%20%28United%20States%29">permanent American resident</a> in July 1929 and <a href="United%20States%20nationality%20law%23Naturalization">an American citizen</a> on March 3, 1931. Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at <a href="RKO">RKO</a> Studios. She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.

Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay "<a href="Red%20Pawn">Red Pawn</a>" to <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> in 1932, although it was never produced. This was followed by the courtroom drama "<a href="Night%20of%20January%2016th">Night of January 16th</a>", first produced by <a href="E.%20E.%20Clive">E. E. Clive</a> in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on <a href="Broadway%20theater">Broadway</a> in 1935. Each night a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on the jury's vote, one of two different endings would be performed. In 1941, <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> produced a <a href="The%20Night%20of%20January%2016th%20%28film%29">movie loosely based on the play</a>. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result. "<a href="Ideal%20%28novel%29">Ideal</a>" is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate. The heroine is an actress who embodies Randian ideals.

Rand's first published novel, the semi-autobiographical "<a href="We%20the%20Living">We the Living</a>", was published in 1936. Set in <a href="Soviet%20Russia">Soviet Russia</a>, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that "We the Living" "is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not ..." Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print, although European editions continued to sell. After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies. In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, "Noi vivi" and "Addio, Kira". Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as "<a href="We%20the%20Living%20%28film%29">We the Living</a>" in 1986.

Her novella "<a href="Anthem%20%28novella%29">Anthem</a>" was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, "The Fountainhead". It presents a vision of a <a href="dystopian">dystopian</a> future world in which <a href="totalitarian">totalitarian</a> collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with "We the Living", Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.

During the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband worked as full-time volunteers for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican <a href="Wendell%20Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a>. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had viewed pro-Willkie <a href="newsreels">newsreels</a>. This activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist <a href="Henry%20Hazlitt">Henry Hazlitt</a> and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the <a href="Austrian%20School">Austrian School</a> economist <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a>. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to Rand as "the most courageous man in America", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said "man" instead of "woman". Rand also became friends with libertarian writer <a href="Isabel%20Paterson">Isabel Paterson</a>. Rand questioned Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only <a href="non-fiction">non-fiction</a> book, "<a href="The%20God%20of%20the%20Machine">The God of the Machine</a>".

Rand's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with "<a href="The%20Fountainhead">The Fountainhead</a>", a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years. The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named <a href="Howard%20Roark">Howard Roark</a> and his struggle against what Rand described as "second-handers"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the <a href="Bobbs-Merrill%20Company">Bobbs-Merrill Company</a> on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a> <a href="Benzedrine">Benzedrine</a> to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest. Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.

"The Fountainhead" became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security. In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a <a href="The%20Fountainhead%20%28film%29">film version</a> to <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer <a href="Hal%20B.%20Wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a> as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscar</a>-nominated "<a href="Love%20Letters%20%281945%20film%29">Love Letters</a>" and "<a href="You%20Came%20Along">You Came Along</a>". Rand also worked on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called "The Moral Basis of Individualism". Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled "The Only Path to Tomorrow" in the January 1944 edition of "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" magazine.
Rand extended her involvement with free-market and <a href="anti-communist">anti-communist</a> activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Alliance%20for%20the%20Preservation%20of%20American%20Ideals">Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals</a>, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist <a href="American%20Writers%20Association">American Writers Association</a>. A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies. In 1947, during the <a href="Second%20Red%20Scare">Second Red Scare</a>, Rand testified as a "friendly witness" before the United States <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film "<a href="Song%20of%20Russia">Song of Russia</a>". Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was. She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film "<a href="The%20Best%20Years%20of%20Our%20Lives">The Best Years of Our Lives</a>" for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it. When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as "futile".

After several delays, the film version of "The Fountainhead" was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she "disliked the movie from beginning to end", and complained about its editing, acting, and other elements.

In the years following the publication of "The Fountainhead", Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated "The Collective") included future <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Chairman">Federal Reserve Chairman</a> <a href="Alan%20Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later <a href="Nathaniel%20Branden">Nathaniel Branden</a>) and his wife <a href="Barbara%20Branden">Barbara</a> and Barbara's cousin <a href="Leonard%20Peikoff">Leonard Peikoff</a>. Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. She later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, "Atlas Shrugged", as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.

"Atlas Shrugged", published in 1957, was considered Rand's "<a href="magnum%20opus">magnum opus</a>". Rand described the theme of the novel as "the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest". It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">Objectivism</a> and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a> government by going on <a href="Strike%20action">strike</a> and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, <a href="John%20Galt">John Galt</a>, describes the strike as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of <a href="Mystery%20%28fiction%29">mystery</a>, <a href="Romance%20novel">romance</a>, and <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, and it contains an extended exposition of Objectivism in the form of a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.

Despite many negative reviews, "Atlas Shrugged" became an international bestseller. In an interview with <a href="Mike%20Wallace">Mike Wallace</a>, Rand declared herself "the most creative thinker alive". However, Rand was discouraged and depressed by the reaction of intellectuals to the novel. "Atlas Shrugged" was Rand's last completed work of fiction; it marked the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.

In 1958, Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the <a href="Nathaniel%20Branden%20Institute">Nathaniel Branden Institute</a> (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for <a href="Objectivist%20periodicals">Objectivist periodicals</a> that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the <a href="Objectivist%20movement">Objectivist movement</a> itself as a <a href="cult">cult</a> or religion. Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as <a href="Yale">Yale</a>, <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a>, <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia</a>, <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a>, and the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. She received an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Humane%20Letters">Doctorate of Humane Letters</a> from <a href="Lewis%20%26amp%3B%20Clark%20College">Lewis & Clark College</a> on 2 October 1963. She also began delivering annual lectures at the <a href="Ford%20Hall%20Forum">Ford Hall Forum</a>, responding afterward to questions from the audience. During these speeches and Q&A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights, opposing the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> and the <a href="military%20draft">military draft</a> (but condemning many <a href="draft%20dodgers">draft dodgers</a> as "bums"), supporting <a href="Israel">Israel</a> in the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a> of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as "civilized men fighting savages", saying <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">European colonists</a> had the right to develop land taken from <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">American Indians</a>, and calling <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a> "immoral" and "disgusting", while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it. She also endorsed several <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidates for President of the United States, most strongly <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201964">1964</a>, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for "The Objectivist Newsletter".
In 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended, Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI. Rand published an article in "The Objectivist" repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other "irrational behavior in his private life". Branden later apologized in an interview to "every student of Objectivism" for "perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique" and for "contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement". In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.

Rand underwent surgery for <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking. In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, she allowed social worker Evva Pryor, an employee of her attorney, to enroll her in <a href="Social%20Security%20%28United%20States%29">Social Security</a> and <a href="Medicare%20%28United%20States%29">Medicare</a>. During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979. One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of "Atlas Shrugged".

Rand died of <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a> on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City, and was interred in the <a href="Kensico%20Cemetery">Kensico Cemetery</a>, <a href="Valhalla%2C%20New%20York">Valhalla, New York</a>. Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including <a href="Alan%20Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>. A floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket. In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff to inherit her estate.

Rand called her philosophy "Objectivism", describing its essence as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute". She considered Objectivism a <a href="systematic%20philosophy">systematic philosophy</a> and laid out positions on <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>, <a href="ethics">ethics</a>, <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a>, and <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>.

In metaphysics, Rand supported <a href="philosophical%20realism">philosophical realism</a>, and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.

In <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered <a href="axiom">axiom</a>atic, and <a href="reason">reason</a>, which she described as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses". She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or "<a href="A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">a priori</a>" knowledge, including instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing. In her "<a href="Introduction%20to%20Objectivist%20Epistemology">Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</a>", Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the <a href="analytic%E2%80%93synthetic%20dichotomy">analytic–synthetic dichotomy</a>.

In ethics, Rand argued for <a href="Rational%20egoism">rational</a> and <a href="ethical%20egoism">ethical egoism</a> (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should "exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself". She referred to egoism as "the virtue of selfishness" in her <a href="The%20Virtue%20of%20Selfishness">book of that title</a>, in which she presented her solution to the <a href="is-ought%20problem">is-ought problem</a> by describing a <a href="meta-ethical">meta-ethical</a> theory that based morality in the needs of "man's survival "qua" man". She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness, and held that the <a href="initiation%20of%20force">initiation of force</a> was evil and irrational, writing in "Atlas Shrugged" that "Force and mind are opposites."

Rand's political philosophy emphasized <a href="individual%20rights">individual rights</a> (including <a href="Private%20property">property rights</a>), and she considered "<a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a>" <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights. She opposed <a href="statism">statism</a>, which she understood to include <a href="theocracy">theocracy</a>, <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarchy</a>, <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>, <a href="fascism">fascism</a>, <a href="communism">communism</a>, <a href="democratic%20socialism">democratic socialism</a>, and <a href="dictatorship">dictatorship</a>. Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government. Although her political views are often classified as <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">conservative</a> or <a href="libertarian">libertarian</a>, she preferred the term "radical for capitalism". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics. She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>. She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in <a href="subjectivism">subjectivism</a> that could only lead to collectivism in practice.

In aesthetics, Rand defined art as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments". According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness. As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered <a href="romanticism">romanticism</a> to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human <a href="free%20will">free will</a>. She described her own approach to literature as "<a href="romantic%20realism">romantic realism</a>".

Rand acknowledged <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> as her greatest influence and remarked that in the <a href="history%20of%20philosophy">history of philosophy</a> she could only recommend "three A's"—Aristotle, <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Aquinas</a>, and Ayn Rand. In a 1959 interview with <a href="Mike%20Wallace">Mike Wallace</a>, when asked where her philosophy came from she responded: "Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself." However, she also found early inspiration in <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals, in passages from the first edition of "We the Living" (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style. However, by the time she wrote "The Fountainhead", Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed. <a href="Rational%20egoism">Rational egoism</a> was embodied by Russian author <a href="Nikolay%20Chernyshevsky">Nikolay Chernyshevsky</a> in the 1863 book "<a href="What%20Is%20to%20Be%20Done%3F%20%28novel%29">What Is to Be Done?</a>" and several critics claim that "What Is to Be Done?" is one of the sources of inspiration for Rand's thought. For example, the book's main character Lopuhov says "I am not a man to make sacrifices. And indeed there are no such things. One acts in the way that one finds most pleasant." Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, whom she referred to as a "monster", although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.

Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her "theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force". She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy, stating: "I am not "primarily" an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not "primarily" an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows."

During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, "We the Living", was admired by the literary critic <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a>, her Broadway play "Night of January 16th" was both a critical and popular success, and "The Fountainhead" was hailed by a reviewer in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" as "masterful". Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic. However, they became <a href="bestseller">bestseller</a>s largely through word of mouth.

The first reviews Rand received were for "Night of January 16th". Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer. Rand believed that her first novel, "We the Living", was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says "it was the most reviewed of any of her works", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work. Her 1938 novella "Anthem" received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.

Rand's first bestseller, "The Fountainhead", received far fewer reviews than "We the Living", and reviewers' opinions were mixed. There was a positive review in "The New York Times" that Rand greatly appreciated. The reviewer called Rand "a writer of great power" who wrote "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", and stated that "you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time". There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications. Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it "a whale of a book" and another that said "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style "offensively pedestrian".

Rand's 1957 novel "Atlas Shrugged" was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative. In "<a href="National%20Review">National Review</a>", conservative author <a href="Whittaker%20Chambers">Whittaker Chambers</a> called the book "sophomoric" and "remarkably silly". He described the tone of the book as "shrillness without reprieve" and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the <a href="Religion%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviets</a>), claiming "From almost any page of "Atlas Shrugged", a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber—go!. "Atlas Shrugged" received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer <a href="John%20Chamberlain%20%28journalist%29">John Chamberlain</a>, but Rand scholar <a href="Mimi%20Reisel%20Gladstein">Mimi Reisel Gladstein</a> later wrote that "reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs", calling it "execrable claptrap" and "a nightmare"—they also said it was "written out of hate" and showed "remorseless hectoring and prolixity".

Rand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, "<a href="For%20the%20New%20Intellectual">For the New Intellectual</a>", was similar to that for "Atlas Shrugged", with philosopher <a href="Sidney%20Hook">Sidney Hook</a> likening her certainty to "the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union", and author <a href="Gore%20Vidal">Gore Vidal</a> calling her viewpoint "nearly perfect in its immorality". Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.

On the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth in 2005, <a href="Edward%20Rothstein">Edward Rothstein</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", referred to her fictional writing as quaint <a href="utopian">utopian</a> "retro fantasy" and programmatic <a href="neo-Romanticism">neo-Romanticism</a> of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters' "isolated rejection of democratic society". In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as "romance novels with a patina of <a href="pseudo-philosophy">pseudo-philosophy</a>". In 2009, "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>"s critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as "capitalism's version of middlebrow religious novels" such as "" and the "<a href="Left%20Behind">Left Behind</a>" series.

In 1991, a survey conducted for the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> and the <a href="Book-of-the-Month%20Club">Book-of-the-Month Club</a> asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" was the second most popular choice, after the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29 million copies sold (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the <a href="Ayn%20Rand%20Institute">Ayn Rand Institute</a>). In 1998, <a href="Modern%20Library">Modern Library</a> readers voted "Atlas Shrugged" the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by "The Fountainhead" in second place, "Anthem" in seventh, and "We the Living" eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list. Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work. Rand's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India.

Rand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, such as <a href="Ira%20Levin">Ira Levin</a>, <a href="Kay%20Nolte%20Smith">Kay Nolte Smith</a> and <a href="L.%20Neil%20Smith">L. Neil Smith</a>; and later writers such as <a href="Erika%20Holzer">Erika Holzer</a> and <a href="Terry%20Goodkind">Terry Goodkind</a> have been influenced by her. Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> artist <a href="Steve%20Ditko">Steve Ditko</a> and musician <a href="Neil%20Peart">Neil Peart</a> of <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a>. Rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work. <a href="John%20A.%20Allison%20IV">John Allison</a> of <a href="BB%26amp%3BT">BB&T</a> and <a href="Ed%20Snider">Ed Snider</a> of <a href="Comcast%20Spectacor">Comcast Spectacor</a> have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas, while <a href="Mark%20Cuban">Mark Cuban</a> (owner of the <a href="Dallas%20Mavericks">Dallas Mavericks</a>) as well as <a href="John%20P.%20Mackey">John P. Mackey</a> (CEO of <a href="Whole%20Foods">Whole Foods</a>) among others have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.

Rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows, as well as in movies and video games. She, or a character based on her, figures prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors. <a href="Nick%20Gillespie">Nick Gillespie</a>, editor in chief of "<a href="Reason%20%28magazine%29">Reason</a>", has remarked that "Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist..." and that "jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, run through the popular culture". Two movies have been made about Rand's life. A 1997 documentary film, "", was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Documentary%20Feature">Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature</a>. "<a href="The%20Passion%20of%20Ayn%20Rand%20%28film%29">The Passion of Ayn Rand</a>", a 1999 television adaptation of the <a href="The%20Passion%20of%20Ayn%20Rand%20%28book%29">book of the same name</a>, won several awards. Rand's image also appears on a <a href="List%20of%20people%20on%20stamps%20of%20the%20United%20States%23R">1999</a> <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. postage stamp</a> illustrated by artist <a href="Nick%20Gaetano">Nick Gaetano</a>.

Although she rejected the labels "<a href="conservative">conservative</a>" and "<a href="libertarian">libertarian</a>", Rand has had continuing influence on <a href="right-wing%20politics">right-wing politics</a> and libertarianism. <a href="Jim%20Powell%20%28historian%29">Jim Powell</a>, a senior fellow at the <a href="Cato%20Institute">Cato Institute</a>, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with <a href="Rose%20Wilder%20Lane">Rose Wilder Lane</a> and <a href="Isabel%20Paterson">Isabel Paterson</a>) of modern <a href="American%20libertarianism">American libertarianism</a>, and <a href="David%20Nolan%20%28libertarian%29">David Nolan</a>, one of the founders of the <a href="Libertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Libertarian Party</a>, stated that "without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist". In his history of the libertarian movement, journalist <a href="Brian%20Doherty%20%28journalist%29">Brian Doherty</a> described her as "the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large" and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as "the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right". Economist and Ayn Rand student <a href="George%20Reisman">George Reisman</a> wrote: "Ayn Rand...in particular, must be cited as providing a philosophical foundation for the case of capitalism, and as being responsible probably more than anyone else for the current spread of pro-capitalist ideas."
She faced intense opposition from <a href="William%20F.%20Buckley%2C%20Jr.">William F. Buckley, Jr.</a> and other contributors for the "<a href="National%20Review">National Review</a>" magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by <a href="Whittaker%20Chambers">Whittaker Chambers</a>, <a href="Garry%20Wills">Garry Wills</a>, and <a href="M.%20Stanton%20Evans">M. Stanton Evans</a>. Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other "National Review" contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.

The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party), despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being <a href="pro-choice">pro-choice</a> and an atheist. A 1987 article in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" referred to her as the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan administration</a>'s "novelist laureate". Republican <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congressmen</a> and conservative <a href="pundits">pundits</a> have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels.

The <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a> spurred renewed interest in her works, especially "Atlas Shrugged", which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis. Opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel. During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero <a href="John%20Galt">John Galt</a> appeared at <a href="Tea%20Party%20protests">Tea Party protests</a>. There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the <a href="political%20left">political left</a>, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of <a href="Rational%20egoism%23Ayn%20Rand">selfishness</a> and <a href="free%20markets">free markets</a>, particularly through her influence on <a href="Alan%20Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>. For example, "<a href="Mother%20Jones%20%28magazine%29">Mother Jones</a>" remarked that "Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed" while equating Randian individual well-being with that of the "Volk" according to Goebbels. Corey Robin of "<a href="The%20Nation">The Nation</a>" alleged similarities between the "moral syntax of Randianism" and fascism.

During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars. When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand "a treacherous undertaking" that could lead to "guilt by association" for taking her seriously. A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in "<a href="The%20Personalist">The Personalist</a>". One of these was "On the Randian Argument" by libertarian philosopher <a href="Robert%20Nozick">Robert Nozick</a>, who argued that her <a href="meta-ethical">meta-ethical</a> argument is unsound and fails to solve the <a href="is%E2%80%93ought%20problem">is–ought problem</a> posed by <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>. Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in "The Personalist" arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case. Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.

Since Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased. Historian Jennifer Burns has identified "three overlapping waves" of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is "an explosion of scholarship" since the year 2000. However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.

Gladstein, <a href="Harry%20Binswanger">Harry Binswanger</a>, <a href="Allan%20Gotthelf">Allan Gotthelf</a>, <a href="John%20Hospers">John Hospers</a>, <a href="Edwin%20A.%20Locke">Edwin A. Locke</a>, Wallace Matson, <a href="Leonard%20Peikoff">Leonard Peikoff</a>, <a href="Chris%20Matthew%20Sciabarra">Chris Matthew Sciabarra</a>, and <a href="Tara%20Smith%20%28philosopher%29">Tara Smith</a> have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Ayn%20Rand%20Studies">Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</a>", a nonpartisan <a href="peer-reviewed%20journal">peer-reviewed journal</a> dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work. In 1987 Gotthelf, George Walsh and <a href="David%20Kelley">David Kelley</a> co-founded the Ayn Rand Society, a group affiliated with the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Association">American Philosophical Association</a>. In 2012, the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh%20Press">University of Pittsburgh Press</a> launched an "Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies" series based on the proceedings of the Society. Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including "Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist", a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Press">Cambridge University Press</a>. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at <a href="Clemson%20University">Clemson</a> and <a href="Duke%20University">Duke</a> universities. Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.

Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and <a href="Douglas%20B.%20Rasmussen">Douglas B. Rasmussen</a>, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as "literary, hyperbolic and emotional". Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite "the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage", Rand's ethics are "a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought". In the "<a href="The%20Literary%20Encyclopedia%20%28English%29">Literary Encyclopedia</a>" entry for Rand written in 2001, <a href="John%20David%20Lewis">John David Lewis</a> declared that "Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation". In a 1999 interview in the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Higher%20Education">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>", Sciabarra commented, "I know they laugh at Rand", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.

Libertarian philosopher <a href="Michael%20Huemer">Michael Huemer</a> argues that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics, which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence. He attributes the attention she receives to her being a "compelling writer", especially as a novelist. "Atlas Shrugged" thus outsells Rand's non-fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of <a href="classical%20liberalism">classical liberalism</a> such as <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a>, or <a href="Frederic%20Bastiat">Frederic Bastiat</a>.

Political scientist <a href="Charles%20Murray%20%28political%20scientist%29">Charles Murray</a>, while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only "philosophical debt" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>. Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.

In 1985, Rand's intellectual heir Leonard Peikoff established the <a href="Ayn%20Rand%20Institute">Ayn Rand Institute</a>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, philosopher <a href="David%20Kelley">David Kelley</a> founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as <a href="The%20Atlas%20Society">The Atlas Society</a>. In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia. The charitable foundation of <a href="BB%26amp%3BT%20Corporation">BB&T Corporation</a> has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a>, and <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases, these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.

Allan Dwan

Allan Dwan (3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.

Born Joseph Aloysius Dwan in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, Canada, Dwan, was the younger son of commercial traveller of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857–1917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan, "née" Hunt. The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old, on 4 December 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883–1964), became a physician. At the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a>, Allan Dwan studied engineering and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when <a href="Essanay%20Studios">Essanay Studios</a> offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Directors%20Association">Motion Picture Directors Association</a>.

Dwan operated <a href="Flying%20A%20Studios">Flying A Studios</a> in <a href="La%20Mesa%2C%20California">La Mesa, California</a> from August 1911 to July 1912. Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the <a href="Flying%20A%20Studios">Flying A Studios</a> origins in <a href="La%20Mesa%2C%20California">La Mesa, California</a>.

After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American <a href="Mary%20Pickford">Mary Pickford</a> in several very successful movies as well as her husband, <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a>, notably in the acclaimed 1922 "<a href="Robin%20Hood%20%281922%20film%29">Robin Hood</a>". Dwan directed <a href="Gloria%20Swanson">Gloria Swanson</a> in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process <a href="Phonofilm">Phonofilm</a>. This short, also featuring <a href="Thomas%20Meighan">Thomas Meighan</a> and <a href="Henri%20de%20la%20Falaise">Henri de la Falaise</a>, was produced as a joke, for the 26 April 1925 "Lambs' Gambol" for <a href="The%20Lambs">The Lambs</a>, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.

Following the introduction of the <a href="sound%20film">talkies</a>, Dwan directed child-star <a href="Shirley%20Temple">Shirley Temple</a> in "<a href="Heidi%20%281937%20film%29">Heidi</a>" (1937) and "<a href="Rebecca%20of%20Sunnybrook%20Farm%20%281938%20film%29">Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</a>" (1938).

Dwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, <a href="Victor%20Fleming">Victor Fleming</a>, who went on to direct "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>" and "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone With the Wind</a>", and <a href="Marshall%20Neilan">Marshall Neilan</a>, who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, "<a href="Sands%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Sands of Iwo Jima</a>". He directed his last movie in 1961.

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the <a href="San%20Fernando%20Mission%20Cemetery">San Fernando Mission Cemetery</a>, <a href="Mission%20Hills%2C%20California">Mission Hills, California</a>.

Dwan has a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> at 6263 <a href="Hollywood%20Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>.

Daniel Eagan of "<a href="Film%20Journal%20International">Film Journal International</a>" described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style "is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion."

Algeria

Algeria (; ', familary <a href="Algerian%20Arabic">Algerian Arabic</a> '; ), officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> (<a href="North%20Africa">North</a><a href="west%20Africa">west Africa</a>) on the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean coast</a>. The capital and most populous city is <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, located in the far north of the country. With an area of , Algeria is the <a href="list%20of%20countries%20and%20dependencies%20by%20area">tenth-largest country in the world</a>, and the largest in Africa since <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a> became independent from <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> in 2011. Algeria is bordered to the northeast by <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, to the east by <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, to the west by <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, to the southwest by the <a href="Western%20Sahara">Western Sahara</a>n territory, <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>, and <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, to the southeast by <a href="Niger">Niger</a>, and to the north by the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. The country is a <a href="Semi-presidential%20system">semi-presidential republic</a> consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes (counties).

Ancient Algeria has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a>ns, <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>ns, <a href="Punic">Carthaginians</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a>, <a href="Umayyad">Umayyad</a>s, <a href="Abbasid">Abbasid</a>s, <a href="Idrisid">Idrisid</a>, <a href="Aghlabid">Aghlabid</a>, <a href="Rustamid">Rustamid</a>, <a href="Fatimid">Fatimid</a>s, <a href="Zirid">Zirid</a>, <a href="Hammadids">Hammadids</a>, <a href="Almoravids">Almoravids</a>, <a href="Almohads">Almohads</a>, <a href="Spaniards">Spaniards</a>, <a href="Ottomans">Ottomans</a> and the <a href="French%20Algeria">French colonial empire</a>. <a href="Berbers">Berbers</a> are the indigenous inhabitants of Algeria.

Algeria is a <a href="regional%20power">regional</a> and <a href="middle%20power">middle power</a>. The North African country supplies large amounts of <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> to Europe, and energy exports are the backbone of the economy. According to <a href="OPEC">OPEC</a> Algeria has the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20proven%20oil%20reserves">16th largest</a> oil reserves in the world and the second largest in <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, while it has the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20natural%20gas%20proven%20reserves">9th largest reserves</a> of <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>. <a href="Sonatrach">Sonatrach</a>, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa. Algeria has one of the largest militaries in Africa and the largest defence budget on the continent; most of Algeria's weapons are imported from <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, with whom they are a close ally. Algeria is a member of the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a>, the <a href="Arab%20League">Arab League</a>, <a href="OPEC">OPEC</a>, the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> and is a founding member of the <a href="Arab%20Maghreb%20Union">Arab Maghreb Union</a>.

The country's name derives from the city of <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>. The city's name in turn derives from the Arabic ' (, "The Islands"), a truncated form of the older ' (, "Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe"), employed by medieval geographers such as <a href="Muhammad%20al-Idrisi">al-Idrisi</a>.

In the region of Ain Hanech (<a href="Sa%C3%AFda%20Province">Saïda Province</a>), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> were found. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the <a href="Levallois%20technique">Levalloisian</a> and <a href="Mousterian">Mousterian</a> styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of <a href="Middle%20Paleolithic">Middle Paleolithic</a> <a href="Flake%20tool">Flake tool</a> techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called <a href="Aterian">Aterian</a> (after the archeological site of <a href="Bir%20el%20Ater">Bir el Ater</a>, south of <a href="T%C3%A9bessa">Tebessa</a>).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called <a href="Iberomaurusian">Iberomaurusian</a> (located mainly in the <a href="Oran">Oran</a> region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the <a href="Tassili%20n%27Ajjer">Tassili n'Ajjer</a> paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period. The mixture of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called <a href="Berber%20people">Berbers</a>, who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.

From their principal center of power at <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>, the <a href="Carthaginians">Carthaginians</a> expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n presence existed at <a href="Tipasa">Tipasa</a>, east of <a href="Cherchell">Cherchell</a>, <a href="Hippo%20Regius">Hippo Regius</a> (modern <a href="Annaba">Annaba</a>) and <a href="Rusicade">Rusicade</a> (modern <a href="Skikda">Skikda</a>). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the <a href="Mercenary%20War">Revolt of the Mercenaries</a>, Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First Punic War</a>. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a>.

In 146 BC the city of <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a>, behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay <a href="Mauretania">Mauretania</a>, which extended across the <a href="Moulouya%20River">Moulouya River</a> in modern-day <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the <a href="Almohads">Almohads</a> and <a href="Almoravids">Almoravids</a> more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of <a href="Masinissa">Masinissa</a> in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>.

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Saint Augustine</a> was the bishop of <a href="Hippo%20Regius">Hippo Regius</a> (modern-day Algeria), located in the Roman province of <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Africa</a>. The Germanic <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> of <a href="Geiseric">Geiseric</a> moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia. They did not make any significant settlement on the land, as they were harassed by local tribes. In fact, by the time the Byzantines arrived Lepcis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous <a href="Amazigh">Laguatan</a> who had been busy facilitating an <a href="Amazigh">Amazigh</a> political, military and cultural revival.

After negligible resistance from the locals, <a href="Muslims">Muslim</a> <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> conquered Algeria in the mid-7th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the newly founded faith of Islam. After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the <a href="Aghlabids">Aghlabids</a>, <a href="Almohads">Almohads</a>, <a href="Abdalwadid">Abdalwadid</a>, <a href="Zirids">Zirids</a>, <a href="Rustamids">Rustamids</a>, <a href="Hammadids">Hammadids</a>, <a href="Almoravids">Almoravids</a> and the <a href="Fatimids">Fatimids</a>.

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, North Africa was home to many great scholars, saints and sovereigns including <a href="Judah%20ibn%20Kuraish">Judah Ibn Quraysh</a>, the first grammarian to suggest the <a href="Afroasiatic%20languages">Afroasiatic</a> language family, the great Sufi masters <a href="Abu%20Madyan">Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)</a> and <a href="Sidi%20El%20Houari">Sidi El Houari</a>, and the Emirs <a href="Abd%20al-Mu%27min">Abd Al Mu'min</a> and <a href="Yaghmurasen%20Ibn%20Zyan">Yāghmūrasen</a>. It was during this time that the <a href="Fatimids">Fatimids</a> or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb. These "Fatimids" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> and <a href="Levant">Levant</a>ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. The <a href="Fatimid%20caliphate">Fatimid caliphate</a> began to collapse when its governors the <a href="Zirids">Zirids</a> seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab <a href="Banu%20Hilal">Banu Hilal</a> and <a href="Banu%20Sulaym">Banu Sulaym</a> against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic <a href="Taghribat%20Bani%20Hilal">Tāghribāt</a>. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero <a href="Khalifa%20al-Zanati">Khālīfā Al-Zānatī</a> asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero <a href="Abu%20Zayd%20al-Hilali">Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī</a> and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The <a href="Zirid">Zirid</a>s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous <a href="Berber%20people">Amazigh</a> tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimid Caliphate</a> made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> coast of Africa, Tihamah, <a href="Hejaz">Hejaz</a> and <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>. Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The <a href="Berber%20people">Amazighs</a> historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, <a href="Sanhadja">Sanhadja</a>, <a href="Houara">Houara</a>, <a href="Zenata">Zenata</a>, <a href="Masmuda">Masmouda</a>, <a href="Kutama">Kutama</a>, Awarba, and <a href="Berghwata">Berghwata</a>). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.

Several <a href="Berber%20people">Amazigh</a> dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. <a href="Ibn%20Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a> provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region, the <a href="Zirid%20dynasty">Zirid</a>, <a href="Banu%20Ifran">Banu Ifran</a>, <a href="Maghrawa">Maghrawa</a>, <a href="Almoravid">Almoravid</a>, <a href="Hammadid">Hammadid</a>, <a href="Almohad">Almohad</a>, <a href="Merinid">Merinid</a>, <a href="Zayyanid%20dynasty">Abdalwadid</a>, <a href="Wattasid">Wattasid</a>, <a href="Meknassa">Meknassa</a> and <a href="Hafsid">Hafsid</a> dynasties.

In the early 16th century, <a href="Spain">Spain</a> constructed fortified outposts (<a href="presidio">presidio</a>s) on or near the Algerian coast. <a href="Spain">Spain</a> took control of few coastal towns like <a href="Mers%20el%20Kebir">Mers el Kebir</a> in 1505; <a href="Oran">Oran</a> in 1509; and <a href="Tlemcen">Tlemcen</a>, <a href="Mostaganem">Mostaganem</a> and <a href="T%C3%A9n%C3%A8s">Ténès</a> in 1510. In the same year, a few merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.

There reigned in <a href="Ifriqiya">Ifriqiya</a>, current Tunisia, a <a href="Berbers">Berber</a> family, <a href="Zirid%20dynasty">Zirid</a>, somehow recognising the suzerainty of the <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimid</a> caliph of <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. Probably in 1048, the Zirid ruler or viceroy, el-Mu'izz, decided to end this suzerainty. The <a href="Fatimid">Fatimid</a> state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition; The Viceroy, el-Mu'izz, also found another means of revenge.

Between the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> and the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> were living <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> tribes expelled from <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a> for their disruption and turbulent influence, both <a href="Banu%20Hilal">Banu Hilal</a> and <a href="Banu%20Sulaym">Banu Sulaym</a> among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the <a href="Nile%20Valley">Nile Valley</a> since the nomads would often loot. The then <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimid</a> vizier devised to relinquish control of the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> and obtained the agreement of his sovereign. This not only prompted the Bedouins to leave, but the <a href="Fatimid">Fatimid</a> treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance.

Whole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>, where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in <a href="Ifriqiya">Ifriqiya</a> by the <a href="Gab%C3%A8s%20Governorate">Gabe</a>s region. The <a href="Zirid">Zirid</a> ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but each meeting, the last under the walls of <a href="Kairouan">Kairouan</a>, his troops were defeated and Arabs remained masters of the field.

The flood was still rising, and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of <a href="Constantine%2C%20Algeria">Constantine</a> where they gradually choked <a href="Beni%20Hammad%20Fort">Qalaa of Banu Hammad</a>, as they had done Kairouan few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> and <a href="Oran">Oran</a> plains. Some were forcibly taken by the <a href="Almohads">Almohads</a> in the second half of the 12th century. We can say that in the 13th century there were in all of <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely Berber.

The region of Algeria was partially ruled by <a href="Ottomans">Ottomans</a> for three centuries from 1516 to 1830. In 1516 the <a href="Turkish%20people">Turkish</a> privateer brothers <a href="Aruj">Aruj</a> and <a href="Hayreddin%20Barbarossa">Hayreddin Barbarossa</a>, who operated successfully under the <a href="Hafsids">Hafsids</a>, moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the <a href="Spaniards">Spaniards</a> but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the "Bani Ziyad" dynasty, to flee. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Tlemcen">Tlemcen</a>, Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> sultan gave him the title of <a href="beylerbey">beylerbey</a> and a contingent of some 2,000 <a href="janissaries">janissaries</a>. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son <a href="Hasan%20Pasha%20%28son%20of%20Barbarossa%29">Hasan</a>, who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an <a href="Agha%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29">agha</a>. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.

<a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">Plague</a> had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691 and 1740–42.

In 1671, the <a href="taifa">taifa</a> rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of <a href="dey">dey</a>. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the <a href="divan">divan</a>, a council of some sixty nobles. It was at first dominated by the "<a href="ojaq">ojaq</a>"; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent, replacing the <a href="pasha">pasha</a> in that role, although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire.

The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of Ottoman government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the <a href="Kabylie">Kabylie</a>.

The <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a> preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea. The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as <a href="slavery">slaves</a>. They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves. They often made raids, called <a href="Ghazi%20%28warrior%29">Razzias</a>, on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at <a href="Arab%20slave%20trade">slave markets</a> in North Africa and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.

In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of <a href="Ischia">Ischia</a>, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of <a href="Lipari">Lipari</a>, almost the entire population. In 1551, <a href="Turgut%20Reis">Turgut Reis</a> enslaved the entire population of the <a href="Malta">Maltese</a> island of <a href="Gozo">Gozo</a>, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending the captives to Libya. In 1554, pirates sacked <a href="Vieste">Vieste</a> in southern Italy and took an estimated 7,000 captives as slaves.

In 1558, Barbary corsairs captured the town of <a href="Ciutadella">Ciutadella</a> (Minorca), destroyed it, slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors as slaves to <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. Barbary pirates often attacked the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>, and in response, the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches. The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of <a href="Formentera">Formentera</a>. Between 1609 and 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates.

In July 1627 two pirate ships from Algiers sailed as far as <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="Turkish%20Abductions">raiding and capturing slaves</a>. Two weeks earlier another pirate ship from <a href="Sale%2C%20Morocco">Salé</a> in <a href="Saadi%20dynasty">Morocco</a> had also raided in Iceland. Some of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back to Iceland, but some chose to stay in Algeria. In 1629 pirate ships from Algeria raided the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>.

Barbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack Spanish merchant shipping, and as a result, the Spanish navy bombarded Algiers in 1783 and 1784. In 1792, <a href="Spain">Spain</a> abandoned Oran, selling it to the Ottoman Empire, and it became the site for a new bey in Algiers, though French influence in the region increased over the 19th century.

In the 19th century, the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "licence tax" in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels. One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793.

Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the <a href="First%20Barbary%20War">First</a> (1801–1805) and <a href="Second%20Barbary%20War">Second Barbary War</a>s (1815). Following those wars, Algeria was weaker and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British <a href="Edward%20Pellew%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Exmouth">Lord Exmouth</a>, <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Algiers%20%281816%29">attacked Algiers</a>. After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by Captain (later Commodore) <a href="Stephen%20Decatur">Stephen Decatur</a> (U.S. Navy) concerning the demands of tributes. In addition, the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving <a href="Christian">Christian</a>s.

Despite being removed from Algeria in the 19th century, Spain retained a presence in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Algeria consistently opposed Spanish fortresses and control in nearby Morocco through the 20th century.

Under the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded and <a href="Invasion%20of%20Algiers%20in%201830">captured Algiers</a> in 1830. Algerian slave trade and piracy ceased when the French conquered Algiers. The <a href="French%20conquest%20of%20Algeria">conquest of Algeria</a> by the French took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872. Historian <a href="Ben%20Kiernan">Ben Kiernan</a> wrote on the French conquest of Algeria: "By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830." French losses from 1831–51 were 3,336 killed in action and 92,329 dead in the hospital. The population of Algeria, which stood at about 1.5 million in 1830, reached nearly 11 million in 1960. French policy was predicated on "civilising" the country. During this period, a small but influential French-speaking indigenous elite was formed, made up of Berbers, mostly <a href="Kabyle%20People">Kabyles</a>.
As a consequence, French government favored the Kabyles. About 80% of Indigenous schools were constructed for Kabyles.

From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and "département" of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of <a href="European%20ethnic%20groups">European</a> <a href="immigrants">immigrants</a>, who became known as "colons" and later, as "<a href="Pied-Noir">Pied-Noir</a>s." Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria. These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land. Many Europeans settled in <a href="Oran">Oran</a> and <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.

During the late 19th and early 20th century; the European share was almost a fifth of the population. The French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of France, and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900. The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonised countries' path in central Asia and Caucasus, Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying French forces was suppressed through what is now known as the <a href="S%C3%A9tif%20and%20Guelma%20massacre">Sétif and Guelma massacre</a>. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the <a href="Algerian%20War">Algerian War</a> began. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 <a href="Harki">Harki</a>s and their dependents were killed by the <a href="National%20Liberation%20Front%20%28Algeria%29">Front de Libération Nationale</a> (FLN) or by <a href="lynching">lynch</a> mobs in Algeria. The FLN used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted <a href="Torture%20during%20the%20Algerian%20War%20of%20Independence">severe reprisals</a>.

The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like <a href="Alistair%20Horne">Alistair Horne</a> and <a href="Raymond%20Aron">Raymond Aron</a>, state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1 million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence. Horne estimated Algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700,000. The war uprooted more than 2 million Algerians.

The war against French rule concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 <a href="Evian%20agreements">Evian agreements</a> and the July 1962 <a href="Algerian%20self-determination%20referendum%2C%201962">self-determination referendum</a>.

The number of European "Pied-Noirs" who fled Algeria totaled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964. The exodus to mainland France accelerated after the <a href="Oran%20massacre%20of%201962">Oran massacre of 1962</a>, in which hundreds of militants entered European sections of the city, and began attacking civilians.

Algeria's first president was the Front de Libération Nationale (<a href="FLN%20%28Algeria%29">FLN</a>) leader <a href="Ahmed%20Ben%20Bella">Ahmed Ben Bella</a>. Morocco's claim to <a href="Greater%20Morocco">portions of western Algeria</a> led to the <a href="Sand%20War">Sand War</a> in 1963. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by <a href="Houari%20Boum%C3%A9di%C3%A8ne">Houari Boumédiène</a>, his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and <a href="authoritarianism">authoritarian</a>; Boumédienne continued this trend. But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He <a href="collective%20farming">collectivised</a> agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. <a href="Extraction%20of%20petroleum">Oil extraction</a> facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>.

In the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a program of industrialization within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene's successor, <a href="Chadli%20Bendjedid">Chadli Bendjedid</a>, introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of <a href="Arabisation">Arabisation</a> in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the <a href="1980s%20oil%20glut">1980s oil glut</a>. Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the <a href="Islamic%20Salvation%20Front">Islamic Salvation Front</a> (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.

In December 1991 the <a href="Islamic%20Salvation%20Front">Islamic Salvation Front</a> dominated the first of two rounds of <a href="Algerian%20legislative%20election%2C%201991">legislative elections</a>. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a <a href="High%20Council%20of%20State%20%28Algeria%29">High Council of State</a> was installed to act as Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil <a href="insurgency">insurgency</a> between the Front's armed wing, the <a href="Armed%20Islamic%20Group%20of%20Algeria">Armed Islamic Group</a>, and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of <a href="List%20of%20massacres%20during%20the%20Algerian%20Civil%20War">civilian massacres</a>. At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding <a href="Air%20France%20Flight%208969">Air France Flight 8969</a>, a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.

Algeria held <a href="Algerian%20presidential%20election%2C%201999">elections in 1999</a>, considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President <a href="Abdelaziz%20Bouteflika">Abdelaziz Bouteflika</a>. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a "Civil Concord" initiative, approved in a <a href="Algerian%20Civil%20Concord%20referendum%2C%201999">referendum</a>, under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The <a href="Groupe%20Salafiste%20pour%20la%20Pr%C3%A9dication%20et%20le%20Combat">Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat</a> (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Army, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.

Bouteflika was re-elected in the <a href="Algerian%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">April 2004 presidential election</a> after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the <a href="Charter%20for%20Peace%20and%20National%20Reconciliation">Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation</a>, which was approved in a <a href="Algerian%20national%20reconciliation%20referendum%2C%202005">referendum in September 2005</a>. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.

In November 2008, the <a href="Algerian%20Constitution">Algerian Constitution</a> was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the <a href="Algerian%20presidential%20election%2C%202009">2009 presidential elections</a>, and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar <a href="Arab%20Spring">protests across the Middle East and North Africa</a>. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a>. The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies. In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform. However, elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.

Algeria is the largest country in Africa, and the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a>. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>. To the north, the <a href="Tell%20Atlas">Tell Atlas</a> form with the <a href="Saharan%20Atlas">Saharan Atlas</a>, further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of <a href="Aures">Aures</a> and <a href="T%C3%A9bessa">Nememcha</a> occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is <a href="Mount%20Tahat">Mount Tahat</a> ( m).

Algeria lies mostly between latitudes <a href="19th%20parallel%20north">19°</a> and <a href="37th%20parallel%20north">37°N</a> (a small area is north of 37°N and south of 19°N), and longitudes <a href="9th%20meridian%20west">9°W</a> and <a href="12th%20meridian%20east">12°E</a>. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural <a href="harbour">harbour</a>s. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a <a href="steppe">steppe</a> landscape ending with the <a href="Saharan%20Atlas">Saharan Atlas</a>; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.

The <a href="Ahaggar%20Mountains">Ahaggar Mountains</a> (), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about south of the capital, Algiers, and just east of <a href="Tamanghasset">Tamanghasset</a>. Algiers, <a href="Oran">Oran</a>, <a href="Constantine%2C%20Algeria">Constantine</a>, and <a href="Annaba">Annaba</a> are Algeria's main cities.

In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">Precipitation</a> is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has <a href="erg%20%28landform%29">ergs</a>, or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to .

The varied vegetation of Algeria includes <a href="coastal">coastal</a>, <a href="mountainous">mountainous</a> and grassy <a href="desert">desert</a>-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization. The most commonly seen animals include the wild <a href="boar">boar</a>s, <a href="jackal">jackal</a>s, and <a href="gazelle">gazelle</a>s, although it is not uncommon to spot <a href="fennecs">fennecs</a> (foxes), and <a href="jerboas">jerboas</a>. Algeria also has a small <a href="African%20leopard">African leopard</a> and <a href="Saharan%20cheetah">Saharan cheetah</a> population, but these are seldom seen. A species of deer, the <a href="Barbary%20stag">Barbary stag</a>, inhabits the dense humid forests in the north-eastern areas.

A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. <a href="Barbary%20macaque">Barbary macaque</a>s are the sole native monkey. Snakes, <a href="monitor%20lizard">monitor lizard</a>s, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s throughout the <a href="semi%20arid">semi arid</a> regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, including the <a href="Barbary%20lion">Barbary lion</a>s, <a href="Atlas%20bear">Atlas bear</a>s and <a href="West%20African%20crocodile">crocodile</a>s.

In the north, some of the native flora includes <a href="Macchia">Macchia</a> scrub, <a href="Olive">olive trees</a>, <a href="oak">oak</a>s, <a href="cedrus">cedars</a> and other <a href="Pinophyta">conifers</a>. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens (<a href="Aleppo%20pine">Aleppo pine</a>, <a href="juniper">juniper</a>, and <a href="evergreen%20oak">evergreen oak</a>) and some deciduous trees. <a href="Ficus">Fig</a>, <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a>, <a href="agave">agave</a>, and various <a href="Arecaceae">palm trees</a> grow in the warmer areas. The <a href="grape%20vine">grape vine</a> is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. <a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>s with wild <a href="olive">olive</a>s are the predominant flora in the remainder of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>.

<a href="Camel">Camel</a>s are used extensively; the desert also abounds with venomous and nonvenomous snakes, <a href="scorpion">scorpion</a>s, and numerous insects.

Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military "décideurs", known as "le pouvoir" ("the power"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be <a href="Mohamed%20Medi%C3%A8ne">Mohamed Mediène</a>, head of the military intelligence. In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired. After the death of General <a href="Larbi%20Belkheir">Larbi Belkheir</a>, Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at <a href="Sonatrach">Sonatrach</a>, and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.

The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation. Algeria has universal <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> at 18 years of age. The President is the head of the <a href="Algerian%20Army">army</a>, the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20Algeria">Council of Ministers</a> and the <a href="High%20Security%20Council">High Security Council</a>. He appoints the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Algeria">Prime Minister</a> who is also the head of government.

The Algerian parliament is <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a>; the lower house, the <a href="People%27s%20National%20Assembly">People's National Assembly</a>, has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20Nation">Council of the Nation</a>, has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president. According to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Algeria">constitution</a>, no political association may be formed if it is "based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, profession, or region". In addition, political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects.

Parliamentary elections were last held in <a href="Algerian%20legislative%20election%2C%202012">May 2012</a>, and were judged to be largely free by international monitors, though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities. In the elections, the <a href="National%20Liberation%20Front%20%28Algeria%29">FLN</a> won 221 seats, the military-backed <a href="National%20Rally%20for%20Democracy%20%28Algeria%29">National Rally for Democracy</a> won 70, and the Islamist <a href="Green%20Algeria%20Alliance">Green Algeria Alliance</a> won 47.

Algeria is included in the European Union's <a href="European%20Neighbourhood%20Policy">European Neighbourhood Policy</a> (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.
Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.

In 2009, the French government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in Algeria. Defense Minister Herve Morin stated that "It's time for our country to be at peace with itself, at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations," when presenting the draft law on the payouts. Algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation.

Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the <a href="Western%20Sahara">Western Sahara</a> have been an obstacle to tightening the <a href="Arab%20Maghreb%20Union">Arab Maghreb Union</a>, nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight.

The military of Algeria consists of the <a href="People%27s%20National%20Army">People's National Army</a> (ANP), the <a href="Algerian%20National%20Navy">Algerian National Navy</a> (MRA), and the <a href="Algerian%20Air%20Force">Algerian Air Force</a> (QJJ), plus the <a href="Territorial%20Air%20Defence%20Forces">Territorial Air Defence Forces</a>. It is the direct successor of the <a href="National%20Liberation%20Army%20%28Algeria%29">National Liberation Army</a> (Armée de Libération Nationale or ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial <a href="military%20occupation">occupation</a> during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62).

Total military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate). Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of 12 months. The military expenditure was 4.3% of the <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP) in 2012. Algeria has the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20number%20of%20military%20and%20paramilitary%20personnel">second largest military</a> in North Africa with the largest defence budget in Africa ($10 billion).

In 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a>SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $1.9 billion. Russia is also building two <a href="Kilo%20class%20submarine">636-type</a> diesel <a href="submarines">submarines</a> for Algeria.

Algeria has been categorized by <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a> as "not free" since it began publishing such ratings in 1972, with the exception of 1989, 1990, and 1991, when the country was labeled "partly free." In December 2016, the "Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor" issued a report regarding violation of <a href="media%20freedom">media freedom</a> in Algeria. It clarified that the Algerian government imposed restriction on <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">freedom of the press</a>; expression; and right to peaceful demonstration, protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the <a href="Broadcast%20media">media</a> and websites. Due to the fact that the journalists and activists criticize the ruling government, some media organizations' licenses are canceled.

Independent and autonomous trade unions face routine harassment from the government, with many leaders imprisoned and protests suppressed. In 2016 a number of unions, many of which were involved in the 2010–2012 Algerian Protests, have been deregistered by the government.

<a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Algeria">Homosexuality</a> is illegal in Algeria. Public homosexual behavior is punishable by up to two years in prison.

Algeria is divided into 48 <a href="provinces%20of%20Algeria">provinces</a> ("<a href="wilaya">wilaya</a>s"), 553 <a href="districts%20of%20Algeria">districts</a> ("<a href="da%C3%AFra">daïra</a>s") and 1,541 <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Algeria">municipalities</a> ("<a href="baladiyah">baladiyah</a>s"). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its <a href="Capital%20city">seat</a>, which is usually the largest city.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are

Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the <a href="World%20Bank%20Group">World Bank</a>. Algeria's currency is the <a href="Algerian%20dinar">dinar</a> (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy. These restrictions are just started to be lifted off recently although questions about Algeria's slow diversifying economy remains.

Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages. The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.

A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past 5 years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.

The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand. If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%. Growth of 3% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013. The rate of inflation was 4% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP. The current-account surplus is estimated at 9.3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$182 billion. Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.

In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $26.9 billion, 62% increase in comparison to 2010 surplus. In general, the country exported $73 billion worth of commodities while it imported $46 billion.

Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in <a href="foreign%20currency%20reserves">foreign currency reserves</a> and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20external%20debt">external debt</a> is extremely low at about 2% of GDP. The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.

In 2011, the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10% and 5.3%, respectively. About 14% of the labor force are employed in the <a href="Agriculture%20in%20Algeria">agricultural sector</a>. Fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing.

Algeria has not joined the <a href="WTO">WTO</a>, despite several years of negotiations.

In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a>-era debt during a visit by <a href="President%20of%20Russia">Russian President</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, <a href="President%20of%20Algeria">Algerian President</a> <a href="Abdelaziz%20Bouteflika">Abdelaziz Bouteflika</a> agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defence systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state arms exporter <a href="Rosoboronexport">Rosoboronexport</a>.

Dubai-based conglomerate Emarat Dzayer Group said it had signed a joint venture agreement to develop a $1.6 billion steel factory in Algeria.

Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an <a href="OPEC">OPEC</a> member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20natural%20gas%20proven%20reserves">10th-largest reserves of natural gas</a> in the world and is the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20natural%20gas%20exports">sixth-largest gas exporter</a>. The U.S. <a href="Energy%20Information%20Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> reported that in 2005, Algeria had of proven <a href="natural%20gas%20reserves">natural-gas reserves</a>. It also ranks <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20proven%20oil%20reserves">16th in oil reserves</a>.

Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.

Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards. Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011, against 48% in 1962, and 70% of budgetary receipts, or USD 71.4 billion.

The Algerian national oil company is <a href="Sonatrach">Sonatrach</a>, which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria. All foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements.

Algeria has invested an estimated 100 billion dinars towards developing research facilities and paying researchers. This development program is meant to advance alternative energy production, especially solar and wind power. Algeria is estimated to have the largest solar energy potential in the Mediterranean, so the government has funded the creation of a solar science park in Hassi R'Mel. Currently, Algeria has 20,000 research professors at various universities and over 780 research labs, with state-set goals to expand to 1,000. Besides solar energy, areas of research in Algeria include space and satellite telecommunications, nuclear power and medical research.

Despite a decline in total <a href="unemployment">unemployment</a>, youth and women unemployment is high. Unemployment particularly affects the young, with a jobless rate of 21.5% among the 15–24 age group.

The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24. The government strengthened in 2011 the job programmes introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the programme to aid those seeking work (Dispositif d'Aide à l'Insertion Professionnelle).

The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.

There are several <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Sites">World Heritage Sites</a> in Algeria including <a href="Al%20Qal%27a%20of%20Beni%20Hammad">Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad</a>, the first capital of the <a href="Hammadid">Hammadid</a> empire; <a href="Tipasa">Tipasa</a>, a Phoenician and later Roman town; and <a href="Dj%C3%A9mila">Djémila</a> and <a href="Timgad">Timgad</a>, both <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> ruins; <a href="M%27Zab%20Valley">M'Zab Valley</a>, a limestone valley containing a large urbanized <a href="oasis">oasis</a>; and the <a href="Casbah">Casbah</a> of Algiers, an important citadel. The only natural <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> is the <a href="Tassili%20n%27Ajjer">Tassili n'Ajjer</a>, a mountain range.

The Algerian road network is the densest in Africa; its length is estimated at 180,000 km of highways, with more than 3,756 structures and a paving rate of 85%. This network will be complemented by the <a href="Algeria%20East%E2%80%93West%20Highway">East-West Highway</a>, a major infrastructure project currently under construction. It is a 3-way, highway, linking <a href="Annaba">Annaba</a> in the extreme east to the <a href="Tlemcen">Tlemcen</a> in the far west. Algeria is also crossed by the <a href="Trans-Sahara%20Highway">Trans-Sahara Highway</a>, which is now completely paved. This road is supported by the Algerian government to increase trade between the six countries crossed: Algeria, <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Niger">Niger</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="Chad">Chad</a> and <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>.

In January 2016 Algeria's population was an estimated 40.4 million, who are mainly <a href="Arab-Berber">Arab-Berber</a> ethnically. At the outset of the 20th century, its population was approximately four million. About 90% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the inhabitants of the Sahara desert are mainly concentrated in <a href="oasis">oases</a>, although some 1.5 million remain <a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic or partly nomadic. 28.1% of Algerians are under the age of 15.

Women make up 70% of the country's lawyers and 60% of its judges and also dominate the field of medicine. Increasingly, women are contributing more to household income than men. 60% of university students are women, according to university researchers.

Between 90,000 and 165,000 <a href="Sahrawi%20people">Sahrawis</a> from Western Sahara live in the <a href="Sahrawi%20refugee%20camps">Sahrawi refugee camps</a>, in the western Algerian Sahara desert. There are also more than 4,000 <a href="Palestinian%20refugee">Palestinian refugee</a>s, who are well integrated and have not asked for assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In 2009, 35,000 <a href="Overseas%20Chinese">Chinese</a> migrant workers lived in Algeria.

The largest concentration of Algerian migrants outside Algeria is in France, which has reportedly over 1.7 million Algerians of up to the second generation.

Indigenous <a href="Berbers">Berbers</a> as well as <a href="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Byzantines</a>, <a href="Arab%20people">Arabs</a>, <a href="Turkish%20people">Turks</a>, various <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africans">Sub-Saharan Africans</a>, and <a href="French%20people">French</a> have contributed to the history of Algeria. Descendants of <a href="Al-Andalus">Andalusian</a> refugees are also present in the population of Algiers and other cities. Moreover, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> was spoken by these <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>ese and <a href="Castilian%20people">Castillian</a> <a href="Moriscos">Morisco</a> descendants deep into the 18th century, and even <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> was spoken at the same time by <a href="Catalonia">Catalan</a> <a href="Moriscos">Morisco</a> descendants in the small town of Grish El-Oued.

Despite the dominance of the Berber culture and ethnicity in Algeria, the majority of Algerians identify with an Arabic-based identity, especially after the Arab nationalism rising in the 20th century. Berbers and Berber-speaking Algerians are divided into many groups with varying languages. The largest of these are the Kabyles, who live in the <a href="Kabylie">Kabylie</a> region east of Algiers, the Chaoui of Northeast Algeria, the Tuaregs in the southern desert and the <a href="Chenouas">Shenwa people</a> of North Algeria.

During the colonial period, there was a large (10% in 1960) <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Europe">European</a> population who became known as "<a href="Pied-Noir">Pied-Noir</a>s". They were primarily of French, <a href="Spanish%20people">Spanish</a> and <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> origin. Almost all of this population left during the war of independence or immediately after its end.

<a href="Berber%20language">Berber</a> and <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> are the official languages. <a href="Algerian%20Arabic">Algerian Arabic</a> (Darja) is the language used by the majority of the population. Colloquial Algerian Arabic is heavily infused with borrowings from French and Berber.

<a href="Berber%20language">Berber</a> has been recognized as a "national language" by the constitutional amendment of 8 May 2002. <a href="Kabyle%20language">Kabyle</a>, the predominant Berber language, is taught and is partially co-official (with a few restrictions) in parts of <a href="Kabylie">Kabylie</a>. In February 2016, the Algerian constitution passed a resolution that would make Berber an official language alongside Arabic.

Although <a href="French%20language">French</a> has no official status, Algeria is the second-largest Francophone country in the world in terms of speakers, and French is widely used in government, media (newspapers, radio, local television), and both the education system (from primary school onwards) and academia due to <a href="French%20rule%20in%20Algeria">Algeria's colonial history</a>. It can be regarded as a <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of Algeria. In 2008, 11.2 million Algerians could read and write in French. An Abassa Institute study in April 2000 found that 60% of households could speak and understand French or 18 million in a population of 30 million then. After an earlier period during which the Algerian government tried to phase out French (which is why it has no official status), in recent decades the government has backtracked and reinforced the study of French and TV programs have reinforced use of the language.

Algeria emerged as a bilingual state after 1962. Colloquial <a href="Algerian%20Arabic">Algerian Arabic</a> is spoken by about 72% of the population and Berber by 27–30%.

Islam is the predominant religion in Algeria, with its adherents, mostly Sunnis, accounting for 99% of the population according to a 2012 CIA World Factbook estimate, and 97.9% according to Pew Research in 2010. There are about 150,000 <a href="Ibadi">Ibadi</a>s in the M'zab Valley in the region of <a href="Ghardaia">Ghardaia</a>.

Algeria has given the Muslim world a number of prominent thinkers, including <a href="Emir%20Abdelkader">Emir Abdelkader</a>, <a href="Abdelhamid%20Ben%20Badis">Abdelhamid Ben Badis</a>, <a href="Mouloud%20Kacem%20Na%C3%AEt%20Belkacem">Mouloud Kacem Naît Belkacem</a>, <a href="Malek%20Bennabi">Malek Bennabi</a> and <a href="Mohamed%20Arkoun">Mohamed Arkoun</a>.

Below is a list of the most important Algerian cities:

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic, <a href="Berber%20languages">Tamazight</a> and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. <a href="List%20of%20Algerian%20writers">Famous novelists</a> of the 20th century include <a href="Mohammed%20Dib">Mohammed Dib</a>, <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a>, <a href="Kateb%20Yacine">Kateb Yacine</a> and <a href="Ahlam%20Mosteghanemi">Ahlam Mosteghanemi</a> while <a href="Assia%20Djebar">Assia Djebar</a> is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were <a href="Rachid%20Mimouni">Rachid Mimouni</a>, later vice-president of <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>, and <a href="Tahar%20Djaout">Tahar Djaout</a>, murdered by an <a href="Islamist">Islamist</a> group in 1993 for his secularist views.

<a href="Malek%20Bennabi">Malek Bennabi</a> and <a href="Frantz%20Fanon">Frantz Fanon</a> are noted for their thoughts on <a href="decolonization">decolonization</a>; <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> was born in <a href="Tagaste">Tagaste</a> (modern-day <a href="Souk%20Ahras">Souk Ahras</a>); and <a href="Ibn%20Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a>, though born in <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a>, wrote the <a href="Muqaddima">Muqaddima</a> while staying in Algeria. The works of the <a href="Senussi">Sanusi</a> family in pre-colonial times, and of <a href="Emir%20Abdelkader">Emir Abdelkader</a> and Sheikh <a href="Ben%20Badis">Ben Badis</a> in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author <a href="Apuleius">Apuleius</a> was born in <a href="Madaurus">Madaurus</a> (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

Contemporary <a href="Algerian%20cinema">Algerian cinema</a> is various in terms of genre, exploring a wider range of themes and issues. There has been a transition from cinema which focused on the war of independence to films more concerned with the everyday lives of Algerians.

Algerian painters, like or Baya, attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonization, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, <a href="Mohamed%20Temam">Mohamed Temam</a>, <a href="Abdelkhader%20Houamel">Abdelkhader Houamel</a> have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of <a href="M%27hamed%20Issiakhem">M'hamed Issiakhem</a>, <a href="Mohammed%20Khadda">Mohammed Khadda</a> and <a href="Bachir%20Yelles">Bachir Yelles</a>, appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations. <a href="Mohammed%20Khadda">Mohammed Khadda</a> and <a href="M%27hamed%20Issiakhem">M'hamed Issiakhem</a> have been notable in recent years.

The historic roots of Algerian literature go back to the <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a>n and <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman Africa</a>n era, when <a href="Apuleius">Apuleius</a> wrote "<a href="The%20Golden%20Ass">The Golden Ass</a>", the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. This period had also known <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, <a href="Nonius%20Marcellus">Nonius Marcellus</a> and <a href="Martianus%20Capella">Martianus Capella</a>, among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionized the Arab world literature, with authors like <a href="Ahmad%20al-Buni">Ahmad al-Buni</a>, <a href="Ibn%20Manzur">Ibn Manzur</a> and <a href="Ibn%20Khaldoun">Ibn Khaldoun</a>, who wrote the <a href="Muqaddimah">Muqaddimah</a> while staying in Algeria, and many others.

<a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a> was an Algerian-born French Pied-Noir author. In 1957 he was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20literature">Nobel Prize in literature</a>.

Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.

As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the "Algerian trilogy" of <a href="Mohammed%20Dib">Mohammed Dib</a>, or even "Nedjma" of <a href="Kateb%20Yacine">Kateb Yacine</a> novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include <a href="Mouloud%20Feraoun">Mouloud Feraoun</a>, <a href="Malek%20Bennabi">Malek Bennabi</a>, <a href="Malek%20Haddad">Malek Haddad</a>, <a href="Moufdi%20Zakaria">Moufdi Zakaria</a>, Abdelhamid Ben Badis, Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa, <a href="Mouloud%20Mammeri">Mouloud Mammeri</a>, <a href="Frantz%20Fanon">Frantz Fanon</a>, and <a href="Assia%20Djebar">Assia Djebar</a>.

In the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are <a href="Rachid%20Boudjedra">Rachid Boudjedra</a>, <a href="Rachid%20Mimouni">Rachid Mimouni</a>, <a href="Leila%20Sebbar">Leila Sebbar</a>, <a href="Tahar%20Djaout">Tahar Djaout</a> and <a href="Tahir%20Wattar">Tahir Wattar</a>.

Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, "the swallows of Kabul" and "the attack" of <a href="Yasmina%20Khadra">Yasmina Khadra</a>, "the oath of barbarians" of <a href="Boualem%20Sansal">Boualem Sansal</a>, "memory of the flesh" of <a href="Ahlam%20Mosteghanemi">Ahlam Mosteghanemi</a> and the last novel by Assia Djebar "nowhere in my father's House".

The Algerian state's interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million (EUR 1.8) allocated to production, specific measures and an ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture in order to promote national production, renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation.

The financial support provided by the state, through the Fund for the Development of the Arts, Techniques and the Film Industry (FDATIC) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence (AARC), plays a key role in the promotion of national production. Between 2007 and 2013, FDATIC subsidised 98 films (feature films, documentaries and short films). In mid-2013, AARC had already supported a total of 78 films, including 42 feature films, 6 short films and 30 documentaries.

Algerian cuisine is rich and diverse. The country was considered as the "granary of Rome". It offers a component of dishes and varied dishes, depending on the region and according to the seasons. The cuisine uses cereals as the main products, since they are always produced with abundance in the country. There is not a dish where cereals are not present.

Algerian cuisine varies from one region to another, according to seasonal vegetables. It can be prepared using meat, fish and vegetables. Among the dishes known, <a href="couscous">couscous</a>, <a href="chorba">chorba</a>, Couscous, Rechta, Chakhchoukha, Berkoukes, Shakshouka, Mthewem, Chtitha, Mderbel, Dolma, Brik or Bourek, Garantita, Lham'hlou, etc. <a href="Merguez">Merguez</a> sausage is widely used in Algeria, but it differs, depending on the region and on the added spices.

Cakes are marketed and can be found in cities either in Algeria, in Europe or North America. However, traditional cakes are also made at home, following the habits and customs of each family. Among these cakes, there are Tamina, Baklawa, Chrik, Garn logzelles, Griouech, Kalb el-louz, Makroud, Mbardja, Mchewek, Samsa, Tcharak, Baghrir, Khfaf, Zlabia, Aarayech, Ghroubiya and Mghergchette. Algerian pastry also contains Tunisian or French cakes. Marketed and home-made bread products include varieties such as Kessra or Khmira or Harchaya, chopsticks and so-called washers Khoubz dar or Matloue.
Other traditional meals sold often as street food include Mhadjeb, Karantika, Doubara.(Chakhchokha-Hassoua-T'chicha-Mahjouba and Doubara)are famous in Biskra.

In 2002, Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1.13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to "improved water sources" was limited to 92% of the population in urban areas and 80% of the population in the rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to "improved sanitation". According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of "reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015". Given Algeria's young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a>, <a href="measles">measles</a>, <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, <a href="cholera">cholera</a> and <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.

Health records have been maintained in Algeria since 1882 and began adding Muslims living in the South to their Vital record database in 1905 during French rule.

Since the 1970s, in a centralized system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian government introduced a decree by which school attendance became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 78.7%.

Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling. From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes. The students can also learn English, Italian, Spanish and German. In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five.
Apart from the 122 private, learning at school, the Universities of the State are free of charge. After nine years of primary school, students can go to the high school or to an educational institution. The school offers two programs: general or technical. At the end of the third year of secondary school, students pass the exam of the baccalaureate, which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes.

Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of six and 15. In 2008, the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3%, 15.6% for men and 29.0% for women. The province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was <a href="Algiers%20Province">Algiers Province</a> at 11.6%, while the province with the highest rate was <a href="Djelfa%20Province">Djelfa Province</a> at 35.5%.

Algeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008. The <a href="University%20of%20Algiers">University of Algiers</a>, founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters). 25 of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country.

Even if some of them offer instruction in <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English. Among the most important universities, there are the <a href="University%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Technology%20Houari%20Boumediene">University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Mentouri">University of Mentouri</a> Constantine, and <a href="University%20of%20Oran">University of Oran</a> Es-Senia. The <a href="University%20of%20Abou%20Bekr%20Belka%C3%AFd">University of Abou Bekr Belkaïd</a> in Tlemcen and <a href="University%20of%20Batna">University of Batna</a> Hadj Lakhdar occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa.

List of Atlas Shrugged characters

This is a list of characters in <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>'s novel "<a href="Atlas%20Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a>."

The following are major characters from the novel.

Dagny Taggart is the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> of the novel. She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. Given James' incompetence, Dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in "Atlas Shrugged", an owner by inheritance of the world's largest <a href="copper">copper</a> mining operation. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart. A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the "climax" of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working while still in school, proving that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his family's wealth and power. Later, Francisco bankrupts the d'Anconia business to put it out of others' reach. His full name is given as "Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia".

John Galt is the primary male hero of "Atlas Shrugged". He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employees' cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.

Before working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company, where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity, but abandoned his prototype, and his employment, when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment. This prototype was found by Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden. Galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel, in a valley by himself, where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership. Much of the book's third division is given to his broadcast speech, which presents the author's philosophy of <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">Objectivism</a>.

Henry (known as "Hank") Rearden is one of the central characters in "Atlas Shrugged". He owns the most important steel company in the United States, and invents Rearden Metal, an <a href="alloy">alloy</a> stronger than steel (with similar properties to stainless steel). He lives in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother. Rearden represents a type of <a href="self-made%20man">self-made man</a> or prototypical hero, and illustrates Rand's <a href="Atlas%20Shrugged%23Theory%20of%20sex">theory of sex</a> in so far as he accepts the traditional view of sexual congress as a subhuman instinct, but responds sexually to Dagny Taggart.

Edwin "Eddie" Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and himself likewise. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. Willers does not possess the creative ability of Galt's associates, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.

One of Galt's first followers, and world-famous as a <a href="pirate">pirate</a>, who seizes relief ships sent from the United States to the People's States of Europe. He works to ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough capital to rebuild the world. Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years. Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a retired <a href="film%20star">film star</a>. Considered a misfit by Galt's other adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt's perspective.

According to <a href="Barbara%20Branden">Barbara Branden</a>, who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld's adventures at sea, cut from the final published text. In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld's name was a tribute to Victor Hugo's novel, "Hans of Iceland", wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld. In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.

The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden, who dislikes his habits and (secretly at first) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value. Lillian achieves this, when she passes information to James Taggart about her husband's affair with his sister. This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others. Lillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual satisfaction, until Hank abandons her.

Ferris is a biologist who works as "co-ordinator" at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled "Why Do You Think You Think?" He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.

A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone). The character was, in part, modeled on <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the "man who knew better" but chose not to act for the good.

The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a>, who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty. In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country.

The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.

Anthropology

Anthropology is the study of <a href="human">human</a>s and <a href="human%20behavior">human behavior</a> and <a href="society">societies</a> in the past and present. <a href="Social%20anthropology">Social anthropology</a> and <a href="cultural%20anthropology">cultural anthropology</a> study the norms and values of societies. <a href="Linguistic%20anthropology">Linguistic anthropology</a> studies how language affects social life. <a href="Biological%20anthropology">Biological or physical anthropology</a> studies the biological development of humans.

<a href="Archaeology">Archaeology</a>, which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.

The abstract noun "<a href="wikt%3Aanthropology">anthropology</a>" is first attested in reference to <a href="history">history</a>. Its present use first appeared in <a href="German%20Renaissance">Renaissance</a> <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Germany</a> in the works of <a href="Magnus%20Hundt">Magnus Hundt</a> and <a href="Otto%20Casmann">Otto Casmann</a>. Their <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> ' derived from the <a href="combining%20form">combining form</a>s of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words "ánthrōpos" (, "<a href="human">human</a>") and "lógos" (, "<a href="science">study</a>"). (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>.) It began to be used in English, possibly via <a href="French%20language">French</a> ', by the early 18th century.

In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a>, defined "" as follows:

Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.

Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Serres">Étienne Serres</a> in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20%28France%29">National Museum of Natural History (France)</a> by <a href="Jean%20Louis%20Armand%20de%20Quatrefages%20de%20Br%C3%A9au">Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau</a>. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Ethnologique%20de%20Paris">Société Ethnologique de Paris</a>, the first to use <a href="Ethnology">Ethnology</a>, was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Société was abandoned.

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the <a href="American%20Ethnological%20Society">American Ethnological Society</a>, was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the <a href="Ethnological%20Society%20of%20London">Ethnological Society of London</a> in 1843, a break-away group of the <a href="Aborigines%27%20Protection%20Society">Aborigines' Protection Society</a>. These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-<a href="Human%20rights">human-rights activists.</a> They maintained international connections.

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as <a href="comparative%20anatomy">anatomy</a>, <a href="Comparative%20method%20%28linguistics%29">linguistics</a>, and <a href="Ethnology">Ethnology</a>, making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then. For them, the publication of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in <a href="agronomy">agronomy</a> and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. <a href="Paul%20Broca">Paul Broca</a> in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20de%20biologie">Société de biologie</a> to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the <a href="Society%20of%20Anthropology%20of%20Paris">Société d'Anthropologie de Paris</a>, meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859. When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to "Transformisme", as the French called <a href="evolutionism">evolutionism</a>. His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".

Broca, being what today would be called a <a href="Neurosurgery">neurosurgeon</a>, had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called <a href="Broca%27s%20area">Broca's area</a> after him. His interest was mainly in <a href="Biological%20anthropology">Biological anthropology</a>, but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, <a href="Theodor%20Waitz">Theodor Waitz</a>, took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled "Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker", 1859–1864. The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples". The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man". By nature he meant matter animated by "the Divine breath"; i.e., he was an <a href="Animism">animist</a>. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation. The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".

Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer <a href="Richard%20Francis%20Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a> and the speech therapist <a href="James%20Hunt%20%28speech%20therapist%29">James Hunt</a> broke away from the <a href="Ethnological%20Society%20of%20London">Ethnological Society of London</a> to form the <a href="Anthropological%20Society%20of%20London">Anthropological Society of London</a>, which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French "Société" were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, "The Anthropological Review", Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard. Among the first associates were the young <a href="Edward%20Burnett%20Tylor">Edward Burnett Tylor</a>, inventor of <a href="cultural%20anthropology">cultural anthropology</a>, and his brother <a href="Alfred%20Tylor">Alfred Tylor</a>, a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the <a href="American%20Anthropological%20Association">American Anthropological Association</a> in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the <a href="Berliner%20Gesellschaft%20f%C3%BCr%20Anthropologie%2C%20Ethnologie%20und%20Urgeschichte">Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory</a> (1869) founded by <a href="Rudolph%20Virchow">Rudolph Virchow</a>, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.

This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical Anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.

Since the work of <a href="Franz%20Boas">Franz Boas</a> and <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Malinowski">Bronisław Malinowski</a> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, "social" anthropology in Great Britain and <a href="cultural%20anthropology">"cultural" anthropology</a> in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on <a href="cross-cultural%20studies">cross-cultural comparisons</a>, long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on <a href="Participant%20observation">participant-observation</a> or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized <a href="cultural%20relativism">cultural relativism</a>, <a href="holism">holism</a>, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from <a href="Boasian%20anthropology">Boas' arguments</a> against 19th-century racial <a href="ideology">ideology</a>, through <a href="Margaret%20Mead">Margaret Mead</a>'s advocacy for <a href="gender%20equality">gender equality</a> and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of <a href="post-colonialism">post-colonial</a> oppression and promotion of <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>. <a href="Ethnography">Ethnography</a> is one of its primary <a href="research%20design">research design</a>s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of <a href="social%20anthropology">social anthropology</a> tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the <a href="four%20field%20approach">four field approach</a> developed by <a href="Franz%20Boas">Franz Boas</a> in the early 20th century: <a href="Biological%20anthropology">"biological" or "physical" anthropology</a>; <a href="social%20anthropology">"social"</a>, <a href="cultural%20anthropology">"cultural"</a>, or <a href="sociocultural%20anthropology">"sociocultural" anthropology</a>; and <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>; plus <a href="linguistic%20anthropology">anthropological linguistics</a>. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more <a href="ethnology">ethnology</a> (a term coined and defined by <a href="Adam%20Franti%C5%A1ek%20Koll%C3%A1r">Adam F. Kollár</a> in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a>s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of "<a href="Human">Homo sapiens</a>", human physical traits, <a href="human%20behavior">human behavior</a>, the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of "Homo sapiens" has influenced its social organization and culture, and from <a href="social%20science">social science</a>s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc. Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity. As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as <a href="cognitive%20science">cognitive science</a>, <a href="global%20studies">global studies</a>, and various <a href="ethnic%20studies">ethnic studies</a>.

According to <a href="Clifford%20Geertz">Clifford Geertz</a>,
<a href="Sociocultural%20anthropology">Sociocultural anthropology</a> has been heavily influenced by <a href="structuralism">structuralist</a> and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an <a href="epistemological">epistemological</a> shift away from the <a href="positivist">positivist</a> traditions that had largely informed the discipline. During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of <a href="cultural%20anthropology">cultural anthropology</a> and <a href="social%20anthropology">social anthropology</a>. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people "make sense" of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the "relationships" among individuals and groups. Cultural anthropology is more related to <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, literature and <a href="the%20arts">the arts</a> (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to <a href="sociology">sociology</a> and history. In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by <a href="cultural%20relativism">cultural relativism</a>, the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values. Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison. This project is often accommodated in the field of <a href="ethnography">ethnography</a>. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic <a href="monograph">monograph</a>. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. <a href="Participant%20observation">Participant observation</a> is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology. <a href="Ethnology">Ethnology</a> involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an <a href="emic">emic</a> (conceptual, vs. <a href="etic">etic</a>, or technical) point of view.

The study of <a href="kinship">kinship</a> and <a href="social%20organization">social organization</a> is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a <a href="human%20universal">human universal</a>. Sociocultural anthropology also covers <a href="Economic%20anthropology">economic</a> and <a href="Political%20anthropology">political organization</a>, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West. Cultures in the <a href="Standard%20Cross-Cultural%20Sample">Standard Cross-Cultural Sample</a> (SCCS) of world societies are:

Biological Anthropology and Physical Anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation. The subject of <a href="biological">biological</a> or physical <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a> is the diversity of man in time and space.Focus on <a href="human">human</a> differentiation combines five areas of interest in biological anthropology:

1.according the <a href="Fossil">fossils</a> record hominid evolution

2<a href="Human%20genetics">.human genetics</a>

3 growth and development of human

4.biological flexibility of human 

5.biology and social life of <a href="Ape">apes</a>, big <a href="Monkey">monkeys</a> and other nonhuman <a href="Hominidae">hominid</a>s.

<a href="Archaeology">Archaeology</a> is the study of the <a href="human">human</a> past through its material remains. <a href="Archaeological%20and%20Anthropological%20Society%20of%20Victoria">Archaeological anthropology</a> reconstructs human behavior and cultural patterns through material remains, depictions and interpretations. The main interest of <a href="Archaeology">archaeologists</a> is to study prehistoric remains. Examination of animal bones reveals the age of the <a href="Animal">animals</a> consumed and provides further information about whether they are wild or domesticated. <a href="Archaeology">Archaeology</a> plays an important role in understanding <a href="Prehistory">prehistoric</a> societies without written records.The comparison of archaeological sequences in different regions allowed <a href="Anthropologist">anthropologists</a> to express the laws of development.<a href="Archaeology">Archaeologist</a>s examine this material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. <a href="Ethnoarchaeology">Ethnoarchaeology</a> is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remain of living <a href="human">human</a> groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past <a href="human">human</a> groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. 

<a href="Linguistic%20anthropology">Linguistic anthropology</a> (not to be confused with <a href="anthropological%20linguistics">anthropological linguistics</a>) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in <a href="language">language</a> across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including <a href="sociolinguistics">sociolinguistics</a>, <a href="pragmatics">pragmatics</a>, <a href="cognitive%20linguistics">cognitive linguistics</a>, <a href="semiotics">semiotics</a>, <a href="discourse%20analysis">discourse analysis</a>, and <a href="narrative">narrative</a> analysis.

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts. To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' "Primitive Art", Claude Lévi-Strauss' "The Way of the Masks" (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes <a href="ethnography">ethnographic studies</a> as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include <a href="cyber%20anthropology">cyber anthropology</a>, a relatively new area of <a href="internet%20research">internet research</a>, as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, <a href="social%20movement">social movement</a>s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, <a href="newspaper">the press</a>, <a href="new%20media">new media</a>, and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.

Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of <a href="ethnography">ethnographic</a> photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, <a href="new%20media">new media</a>. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with <a href="ethnographic%20film">ethnographic film</a>, visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and <a href="reception%20theory">reception</a> of <a href="anthropology%20of%20media">mass media</a>. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology, <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Malinowski">Bronisław Malinowski</a>, and his French compatriot, <a href="Marcel%20Mauss">Marcel Mauss</a>, on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or <a href="Reciprocity%20%28cultural%20anthropology%29">reciprocity</a>) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast. Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the <a href="global%20financial%20system">global financial system</a> from an anthropological perspective.

Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of <a href="Historical%20Materialism">Historical Materialism</a> to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the 'original affluent society' did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist <a href="world-system">world-system</a>. More recently, these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

Applied Anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy". More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to <a href="Development%20anthropology">Development anthropology</a> (distinct from the more critical <a href="Anthropology%20of%20development">Anthropology of development</a>).

Anthropology of development tends to view development from a "critical" perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

"Kinship" can refer both to "the study of" the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to "the patterns of social relationships" themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "<a href="kinship">descent</a>", "<a href="descent%20group">descent group</a>s", "<a href="lineage%20%28anthropology%29">lineages</a>", "<a href="affinity%20%28law%29">affines</a>", "<a href="cognatic%20kinship">cognates</a>", and even "<a href="fictive%20kinship">fictive kinship</a>". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.

Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology (<a href="archaeology">archeological</a>, <a href="biological%20anthropology">biological</a>, <a href="cultural%20anthropology">cultural</a>, <a href="linguistic%20anthropology">linguistic</a>) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the <a href="western%20world">western world</a>. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream <a href="feminist%20theory">feminist theory</a>. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of <a href="http%3A//www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html">birth anthropology</a> as a specialization. The first <a href="African-American">African-American</a> female <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a> and <a href="Caribbeanist">Caribbeanist</a> are said to be <a href="Vera%20Mae%20Green">Vera Mae Green</a> who studied ethnic and family relations in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation". It is believed that William Caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology. Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:
Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as "cultural psychiatry" and "transcultural psychiatry" or "ethnopsychiatry".

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between <a href="economic%20systems">economic systems</a>, <a href="nutrition">nutritional status</a> and <a href="food%20security">food security</a>, and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of <a href="cultural%20anthropology">cultural</a> and <a href="psychology">mental processes</a>. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and <a href="enculturation">enculturation</a> within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human <a href="cognition">cognition</a>, <a href="emotion">emotion</a>, <a href="perception">perception</a>, <a href="motivation">motivation</a>, and <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a>. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.

Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural <a href="innovation">innovation</a>, and transmission over time and space using the methods and <a href="theories">theories</a> of the <a href="cognitive%20sciences">cognitive sciences</a> (especially <a href="experimental%20psychology">experimental psychology</a> and <a href="evolutionary%20biology">evolutionary biology</a>) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and <a href="interpretation%20%28logic%29">interpretation</a> of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.

Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between <a href="altered%20states%20of%20consciousness">altered states of consciousness</a> and culture. As with <a href="transpersonal%20psychology">transpersonal psychology</a>, the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and <a href="transpersonal%20experience">transpersonal experience</a>. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of <a href="Mythology">myth</a>, <a href="ritual">ritual</a>, <a href="diet%20%28nutrition%29">diet</a>, and <a href="Literature">texts</a> in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.

Political anthropology concerns the structure of <a href="Form%20of%20government">political systems</a>, looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study <a href="political%20organization">political organization</a> and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state is an early, famous example.

Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering". Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a>, <a href="legal%20pluralism">legal pluralism</a>, and political uprisings.

Public Anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change" (<a href="http%3A//www.publicanthropology.org">Borofsky 2004</a>).

Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the <a href="American%20Anthropological%20Association">American Anthropological Association</a>'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to <a href="science%20and%20technology%20studies">STS</a> and the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Social%20Studies%20of%20Science">Society for the Social Studies of Science</a>. <a href="Donna%20Haraway">Donna Haraway</a>'s 1985 "<a href="Cyborg%20Manifesto">Cyborg Manifesto</a>" could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and <a href="technology">technology</a> intersect. It is sometimes grouped with <a href="cultural%20anthropology">sociocultural anthropology</a>, and sometimes considered part of <a href="material%20culture">material culture</a>. The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology, digital ethnography, cyberanthropology, and virtual anthropology.

Ecological anthropology is defined as the "study of <a href="cultural%20adaptation">cultural adaptation</a>s to environments". The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their <a href="biophysical%20environment">biophysical environment</a>". The focus of its research concerns "how cultural <a href="beliefs">beliefs</a> and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how their environment across space and time. The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is <a href="political%20ecology">political ecology</a>. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.

Ethnohistory is the study of <a href="Ethnography">ethnographic</a> cultures and <a href="Indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> customs by examining <a href="History">historical records</a>. It is also the study of the history of various <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a>s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.

The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between <a href="magical%20thinking">magical thinking</a> and religion, and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human <a href="community">community</a> that worships it.

Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a>, poverty, and <a href="neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a>. <a href="Ulf%20Hannerz">Ulf Hannerz</a> quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously <a href="agoraphobic">agoraphobic</a> lot, anti-urban by definition". Various social processes in the <a href="Western%20World">Western World</a> as well as in the "<a href="Third%20World">Third World</a>" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "<a href="Anthropology%23Focus%20on%20the%20%26quot%3Bother%20cultures%26quot%3B">specialists in 'other cultures'</a>" closer to their homes. There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.

<a href="Anthrozoology">Anthrozoology</a> (also known as "human–animal studies") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an <a href="interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, <a href="ethology">ethology</a>, medicine, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="veterinary%20medicine">veterinary medicine</a> and <a href="zoology">zoology</a>. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions. It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.

Biocultural anthropology is the <a href="scientific">scientific</a> exploration of the relationships between <a href="human%20biology">human biology</a> and culture. <a href="Biological%20anthropology">Physical anthropologists</a> throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a <a href="Race%20%28classification%20of%20human%20beings%29">racial</a> perspective; that is, from the assumption that <a href="Typology%20%28anthropology%29">typological</a> human biological differences lead to cultural differences. After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the <a href="human%20evolution">evolution</a> of <a href="human%20physiology">human physiology</a> and <a href="human%20behaviour">human behaviour</a> and the relation between <a href="hominins">hominins</a> and non-hominin <a href="primate">primate</a>s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a> and <a href="social%20science">social science</a>, combining the <a href="Human%20development%20%28biology%29">human development</a> with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a <a href="scientific">scientific</a> approach, and brings together fields such as <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>, <a href="behavioral%20ecology">behavioral ecology</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="primatology">primatology</a>, and <a href="genetics">genetics</a>. It is a dynamic and <a href="interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of <a href="physical%20anthropology">physical anthropology</a> and human <a href="osteology">osteology</a> in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a>. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of <a href="paleontology">paleontology</a> and <a href="physical%20anthropology">physical anthropology</a>. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in <a href="fossil">fossil</a> <a href="Hominidae">hominid</a> evidence such as <a href="Petrifaction">petrifacted</a> bones and footprints.

Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the <a href="American%20Anthropological%20Association">American Anthropological Association</a> (AAA), which was founded in 1903. Membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe.

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the <a href="European%20Association%20of%20Social%20Anthropologists">European Association of Social Anthropologists</a> (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as <a href="geology">geology</a>, <a href="physics">physics</a>, <a href="zoology">zoology</a>, <a href="paleontology">paleontology</a>, <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a>, <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a>, <a href="art%20history">art history</a>, <a href="sociology">sociology</a> and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.

As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.

Some commentators have contended:

As part of their quest for <a href="scientific%20objectivity">scientific objectivity</a>, present-day anthropologists typically urge <a href="cultural%20relativism">cultural relativism</a>, which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology. This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting <a href="genocide">genocide</a>, <a href="infanticide">infanticide</a>, <a href="racism">racism</a>, <a href="mutilation">mutilation</a> (including <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> and <a href="subincision">subincision</a>), and <a href="torture">torture</a>. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to <a href="acculturation">acculturation</a> have been proposed, not to mention theories of <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a> and many others as root causes of <a href="Man%27s%20inhumanity%20to%20man">Man's inhumanity to man</a>. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.

Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis Powers</a> (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> and the <a href="Office%20of%20War%20Information">Office of War Information</a>). At the same time, <a href="David%20Price%20%28anthropologist%29">David H. Price</a>'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement. Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the <a href="American%20Anthropological%20Association">American Anthropological Association</a> (AAA).

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a>. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The <a href="Association%20of%20Social%20Anthropologists%20of%20the%20UK%20and%20Commonwealth">Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth</a> (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments ... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given."

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan. The "<a href="Christian%20Science%20Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a>" reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">in Afghanistan</a>, under the "<a href="Human%20Terrain%20System">Human Terrain System</a>" (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the <a href="US%20military%20in%20Iraq">US military in Iraq</a>. In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of "anthropology" within DoD."

Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more <a href="Holism">holistic</a> account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical. The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures). They use many different methods of study, but modern population <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="participant%20observation">participant observation</a> and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork." On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> and the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>, of particular use in archaeology. Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as <a href="Olduwan">Olduwan</a> or <a href="Mousterian">Mousterian</a> or <a href="Levallois%20technique">Levalloisian</a> help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past. Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to <a href="Culture%20regions">Culture regions</a> as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of <a href="comparative%20method">comparative method</a>, a central part of their science.

Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see <a href="History%20of%20Anthropology">History of Anthropology</a>), including but not limited to <a href="Fossil%20collecting">fossil-hunting</a>, <a href="Exploration">exploring</a>, documentary film-making, <a href="paleontology">paleontology</a>, <a href="primatology">primatology</a>, antiquity dealings and curatorship, <a href="philology">philology</a>, <a href="etymology">etymology</a>, <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, regional analysis, <a href="ethnology">ethnology</a>, history, <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, and <a href="religious%20studies">religious studies</a>, it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies). For example, the classic of <a href="urban%20anthropology">urban anthropology</a>, <a href="Ulf%20Hannerz">Ulf Hannerz</a> in the introduction to his seminal "Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology" mentions that the "<a href="Third%20World">Third World</a>" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home". It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and <a href="Sociology">Sociology</a>, on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to <a href="sociologist">sociologist</a>s, but this is increasingly changing, starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like "<a href="Terrain%20%28journal%29">Terrain</a>" ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by <a href="Marc%20Aug%C3%A9">Marc Augé</a> ("<a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20hautes%20%C3%A9tudes%20en%20sciences%20sociales">Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains</a>", the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.

Agricultural science

Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of <a href="biology">biology</a> that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and <a href="social%20science">social science</a>s that are used in the practice and understanding of <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>. (<a href="veterinary%20medicine">Veterinary science</a>, but not <a href="animal%20science">animal science</a>, is often excluded from the definition.)

The three terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:


Agricultural sciences include research and development on:

<a href="Agricultural%20biotechnology">Agricultural biotechnology</a> is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a>, <a href="molecular%20marker">molecular marker</a>s, <a href="molecular%20diagnostics">molecular diagnostics</a>, <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s, and <a href="tissue%20culture">tissue culture</a>, to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s.

One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter. Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's C to N ratio and the local environment.

In the 18th century, <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Mayer%20%28agriculturist%29">Johann Friedrich Mayer</a> conducted experiments on the use of <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> (hydrated <a href="calcium%20sulphate">calcium sulphate</a>) as a fertilizer.

In 1843, <a href="John%20Lawes">John Lawes</a> and <a href="Henry%20Gilbert">Henry Gilbert</a> began a set of long-term field experiments at <a href="Rothamsted%20Research%20Station">Rothamsted Research Station</a> in England; some of them are still running.

In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the <a href="Hatch%20Act%20of%201887">Hatch Act of 1887</a>, which used the term "agricultural science". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The <a href="Smith-Hughes%20Act">Smith-Hughes Act</a> of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built. After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.

Alchemy

Alchemy (from <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> "al-kīmiyā") is a <a href="philosophical">philosophical</a> and <a href="protoscience">protoscientific</a> tradition practiced throughout <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, and <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. It aims to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were <a href="chrysopoeia">chrysopoeia</a>, the <a href="transmutation%20of%20elements">transmutation</a> of "<a href="base%20metal">base metal</a>s" (e.g., <a href="lead">lead</a>) into "<a href="noble%20metal">noble metal</a>s" (particularly <a href="gold">gold</a>); the creation of an <a href="elixir%20of%20immortality">elixir of immortality</a>; the creation of <a href="panacea%20%28medicine%29">panaceas</a> able to cure any disease; and the development of an <a href="alkahest">alkahest</a>, a universal <a href="solvent">solvent</a>. The perfection of the <a href="human%20body">human body</a> and <a href="soul">soul</a> was thought to permit or result from the <a href="Magnum%20opus%20%28alchemy%29">alchemical magnum opus</a> and, in the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> and western tradition, the achievement of <a href="gnosis">gnosis</a>. In Europe, the creation of a <a href="philosopher%27s%20stone">philosopher's stone</a> was variously connected with all of these projects.

In English, the term is often limited to descriptions of European alchemy, but similar practices existed in the <a href="Chinese%20alchemy">Far East</a>, the <a href="Rasayana">Indian subcontinent</a>, and the <a href="Alchemy%20and%20chemistry%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Muslim world</a>. In Europe, following the <a href="12th-century%20Renaissance">12th-century Renaissance</a> produced by the translation of <a href="Islamic%20science">Islamic works on science</a> and the <a href="Recovery%20of%20Aristotle">Recovery of Aristotle</a>, <a href="list%20of%20alchemists">alchemists</a> played a significant role in <a href="early%20modern%20era">early modern</a> <a href="science">science</a> (particularly <a href="history%20of%20chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="history%20of%20medicine">medicine</a>). Islamic and European alchemists developed a structure of basic <a href="laboratory%20techniques">laboratory techniques</a>, theory, terminology, and <a href="experimental%20method">experimental method</a>, some of which are still in use today. However, they continued <a href="classical%20antiquity">antiquity</a>'s belief in <a href="four%20elements">four elements</a> and guarded their work in secrecy including <a href="history%20of%20cryptography">cyphers</a> and cryptic symbolism. Their work was guided by <a href="Hermeticism">Hermetic principles</a> related to <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>, <a href="mythology">mythology</a>, and <a href="religion">religion</a>.

Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its <a href="exoteric">exoteric</a> practical applications and its <a href="esoteric">esoteric</a> spiritual aspects, despite the arguments of scholars like <a href="Eric%20John%20Holmyard">Holmyard</a> and <a href="Marie-Louise%20von%20Franz">von Franz</a> that they should be understood as complementary. The former is pursued by <a href="history%20of%20the%20physical%20sciences">historians of the physical sciences</a> who examine the subject in terms of <a href="history%20of%20chemistry">early chemistry</a>, <a href="history%20of%20medicine">medicine</a>, and <a href="charlatanism">charlatanism</a>, and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred. The latter interests historians of <a href="esotericism">esotericism</a>, <a href="history%20of%20psychology">psychologists</a>, and some philosophers and <a href="spirituality">spiritualists</a>. The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts. Despite this split, which von Franz believes has existed since the Western traditions' origin in a mix of <a href="Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosophy</a> that was mixed with <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20technology">Egyptian</a> and <a href="Mesopotamian%20science">Mesopotamian technology</a>, numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as <a href="Pseudo-Democritus">Pseudo-Democritus</a>'s first-century  "On Physical and Mystical Matters" ().

The word alchemy comes from <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "alquemie", "alkimie", used in <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> as "alchymia". This name was itself brought from the <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> word "al-kīmiyā’" ( or ) composed of two parts: the <a href="Late%20Greek">Late Greek</a> term "khēmeía" (χημεία), "khēmía" (χημία), meaning 'to fuse or cast a metal', and the Arabic <a href="definite%20article">definite article</a> "<a href="al-">al-</a>" (), meaning 'The'. Together this association can be interpreted as 'the process of <a href="Magnum%20opus%20%28alchemy%29">transmutation</a> by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form'. Its roots can be traced to the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a> name "kēme" (hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 "khmi" ), meaning ‘black earth’ which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley, as opposed to red desert sand.

According to the Egyptologist <a href="Wallis%20Budge">Wallis Budge</a>, the Arabic word "al-kīmiyaʾ" actually means "the Egyptian [science]", borrowing from the <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a> word for "Egypt", "kēme" (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval <a href="Bohairic">Bohairic</a> dialect of Coptic, "khēme"). This Coptic word derives from <a href="Demotic%20Egyptian">Demotic</a> "kmỉ", itself from ancient <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a> "kmt". The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour "black" (Egypt was the "Black Land", by contrast with the "Red Land", the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname "Egyptian black arts". However, according to <a href="Carl%20August%20Friedrich%20Mahn">Mahn</a>, this theory may be an example of <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a>. Assuming an Egyptian origin, chemistry is defined as follows:

Thus, according to Budge and others, chemistry derives from an Egyptian word "khemein" or "khēmia", "preparation of black powder", ultimately derived from the name "khem", Egypt. A decree of <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>, written about 300 AD in Greek, speaks against "the ancient writings of the Egyptians, which treat of the "khēmia" <a href="Chrysopoeia">transmutation</a> of gold and silver".

The Medieval Latin form was influenced by Greek "chymeia" (χυμεία) meaning ‘mixture’ and referring to <a href="pharmaceutical%20chemistry">pharmaceutical chemistry</a>.

Alchemy is several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and "genetic" relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: <a href="Chinese%20alchemy">Chinese alchemy</a>, centered in China and its zone of cultural influence; <a href="Rasayana">Indian alchemy</a>, centered on the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean</a> and whose center has shifted over the millennia from <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Greco-Roman Egypt</a>, to the <a href="Muslim%20world">Islamic world</a>, and finally <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval Europe</a>. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a> and Indian alchemy with the <a href="Indian%20religions">Dharmic faiths</a>, whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various <a href="Western%20religion">Western religion</a>s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and <a href="Hellenistic%20Egypt">Hellenistic Egypt</a>, where the city of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods. Here, elements of technology, religion, mythology, and <a href="Hellenistic%20philosophy">Hellenistic philosophy</a>, each with their own much longer histories, combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the West. <a href="Zosimos%20of%20Panopolis">Zosimos of Panopolis</a> wrote the oldest known books on alchemy, while <a href="Mary%20the%20Jewess">Mary the Jewess</a> is credited as being the first non-fictitious Western alchemist. They wrote in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> and lived in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> under <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> rule.

Mythology – Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Pharaonic Egypt</a> where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion. Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation. These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, <a href="Isis">Isis</a>, <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, <a href="Jason">Jason</a>, and many others.

The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is <a href="Hermes%20Trismegistus">Hermes Trismegistus</a> (or Thrice-Great Hermes). His name is derived from the <a href="deity">god</a> <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a> and his Greek counterpart <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>. Hermes and his <a href="caduceus">caduceus</a> or serpent-staff, were among alchemy's principal symbols. According to <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a>, he wrote what were called the "forty-two books of Hermes", covering all fields of knowledge. The "<a href="Hermetica">Hermetica</a>" of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the <a href="hermeticism">hermetic philosophy</a> by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.

Technology – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, extending back to 3500 . Many writings were lost when the <a href="Roman%20Emperor">emperor</a> <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria ( 292). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the <a href="Stockholm%20papyrus">Stockholm papyrus</a> and the <a href="Leyden%20papyrus%20X">Leyden papyrus X</a>. Dating from  300–500, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver. These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of <a href="Bolus%20of%20Mendes">Bolus of Mendes</a> (or <a href="Pseudo-Democritus">Pseudo-Democritus</a>), which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the <a href="classical%20elements">classical elements</a>. Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.

Philosophy – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of <a href="Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreanism</a>, <a href="Platonism">Platonism</a>, <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a> and <a href="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> which formed the origin of alchemy's character. An important example of alchemy's roots in Greek philosophy, originated by <a href="Empedocles">Empedocles</a> and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: <a href="Earth%20%28classical%20element%29">earth</a>, <a href="Air%20%28classical%20element%29">air</a>, <a href="Water%20%28classical%20element%29">water</a>, and <a href="Fire%20%28classical%20element%29">fire</a>. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed. The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; "...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form." Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.

Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. <a href="Lactantius">Lactantius</a> believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth. <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">St Augustine</a> later affirmed this in the 4th & 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry. Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period.

Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as <a href="Moses%20of%20Alexandria">Moses</a>, Isis, <a href="Cleopatra%20the%20Alchemist">Cleopatra</a>, <a href="Pseudo-Democritus">Democritus</a>, and <a href="Ostanes">Ostanes</a>. Others authors such as Komarios, and <a href="Chymes">Chymes</a>, we only know through fragments of text. After  400, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors. By the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline. It was at that time that <a href="Khalid%20Ibn%20Yazid">Khalid Ibn Yazid</a> sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.

The <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a> describe a connection between eternal life and gold. The use of <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">Mercury</a> for alchemy is first documented in the 3rd- or 4th-century "<a href="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a>". <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold. Greek alchemy may have been introduced to Ancient India through the invasions of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> in 325 , and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the Greeks like <a href="Gandh%C4%81ra">Gandhāra</a>, although hard evidence for this is lacking.

The goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body (Sanskrit "divya-deham") and immortality while still embodied (Sanskrit "jīvan-mukti"). Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur, that are homologized with the semen of the god Śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Devī.

Some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the <a href="Kaula%20%28Hinduism%29">Kaula</a> tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of <a href="Matsyendranath">Matsyendranath</a>. Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise "Kalyāṇakārakam" of Ugrāditya, written in South India in the early 9th century.

Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were <a href="Nagarjuna%20%28metallurgist%29">Nāgārjuna Siddha</a> and Nityanātha Siddha. Nāgārjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk. His book, "Rasendramangalam", is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine. Nityanātha Siddha wrote "Rasaratnākara", also a highly influential work. In Sanskrit, "rasa" translates to "mercury", and Nāgārjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold.

Reliable scholarship on Indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of "The Alchemical Body" by David Gordon White. Trustworthy scholarship on Indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account.

An important modern bibliography on Indian alchemical studies has also been provided by David Gordon White at <a href="http%3A//www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0046.xml%3Frskey%3DskoSqW%26amp%3Bresult%3D1%26amp%3Bq%3Drasayana%23firstMatch">Oxford Bibliographies Online</a>.

The contents of 39 Sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in G. Jan Meulenbeld's "History of Indian Medical Literature". The discussion of these works in HIML gives a summary of the contents of each work, their special features, and where possible the evidence concerning their dating. Chapter 13 of HIML, "Various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra" (or "Various works on alchemy and gems") gives brief details of a further 655 (six hundred and fifty-five) treatises. In some cases Meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works; in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles.

A great deal remains to be discovered about Indian alchemical literature. The content of the Sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet (2014) been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy.

After <a href="The%20fall%20of%20the%20roman%20empire">the fall of the Roman Empire</a>, the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations. The word "alchemy" itself was derived from the Arabic word "al-kīmiyā’" (الكيمياء). The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. <a href="Plato">Plato</a>nic and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotelian</a> thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> translations and scholarship.

In the late 8th century, <a href="J%C4%81bir%20ibn%20Hayy%C4%81n">Jābir ibn Hayyān</a> (Latinized as "Geber" or "Geberus") introduced a new approach to alchemy, based on <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>ology and controlled <a href="experiment">experiment</a>ation in the <a href="laboratory">laboratory</a>, in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible, with very little concern for laboratory work. Jabir is thus "considered by many to be the father of <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>", albeit others reserve that title for <a href="Robert%20Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> or <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>. The science historian, Paul Kraus, wrote:

Jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation:

Early Islamic chemists such as <a href="J%C4%81bir%20ibn%20Hayy%C4%81n">Jabir Ibn Hayyan</a>, <a href="Al-Kindi">Al-Kindi</a> ("Alkindus") and <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Zakar%C4%ABya%20R%C4%81zi">Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi</a> ("Rasis" or "Rhazes") contributed a number of key chemical discoveries, such as the muriatic (<a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>), <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric</a> and <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>s, and more. The discovery that <a href="aqua%20regia">aqua regia</a>, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal, gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was "<a href="Takwin">Takwin</a>", the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of "hotness", "coldness", "dryness", and "moistness". According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result. By this reasoning, the search for the <a href="philosopher%27s%20stone">philosopher's stone</a> was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate <a href="numerology">numerology</a> whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.

The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five <a href="classical%20element">classical element</a>s (<a href="aether%20%28classical%20element%29">aether</a>, <a href="Air%20%28classical%20element%29">air</a>, <a href="Earth%20%28classical%20element%29">earth</a>, <a href="Fire%20%28classical%20element%29">fire</a>, and <a href="Water%20%28classical%20element%29">water</a>) in addition to two <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s representing the metals: <a href="Sulfur">sulphur</a>, "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and <a href="Salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a> giving solidity. The <a href="atomic%20theory">atomic theory</a> of <a href="corpuscularianism">corpuscularianism</a>, where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles, also has its origins in the work of Jabir.

From the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including <a href="Al-Kindi">Alkindus</a>, <a href="Ab%C5%AB%20al-Rayh%C4%81n%20al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB">Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī</a>, <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> and <a href="Ibn%20Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a>. In particular, they wrote refutations against the idea of the <a href="Philosopher%27s%20stone">transmutation of metals</a>.

Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine. The <a href="philosopher%27s%20stone">philosopher's stone</a> of European alchemists can be compared to the <a href="Elixir%20of%20life">Grand Elixir of Immortality</a> sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the <a href="Panacea%20%28medicine%29">universal panacea</a>; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.

<a href="Black%20powder">Black powder</a> may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. As previously stated above, <a href="China">Chinese</a> alchemy was more related to medicine. It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a <a href="potion">potion</a> for eternal life. Described in 9th-century texts and used in <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a> in China by the 10th century, it was used in <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s by 1290. From China, the use of <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> spread to Japan, the <a href="Mongol">Mongol</a>s, the Muslim world, and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to <a href="Taoist">Taoist</a> forms of <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a>, such as <a href="Acupuncture">Acupuncture</a> and <a href="Moxibustion">Moxibustion</a>, and to martial arts such as <a href="T%27ai%20chi%20ch%27uan">Tai Chi Chuan</a> and <a href="Kung%20Fu">Kung Fu</a> (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not Alchemical). In fact, in the early <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a>, followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest <a href="cinnabar">mercuric sulfide</a>, which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide. Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan, mastering of the <a href="qi">qi</a>, etc.)

The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with the completion of <a href="Robert%20of%20Chester">Robert of Chester</a>'s translation of the Arabic "Book of the Composition of Alchemy". Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century <a href="Toledo%2C%20Spain">Toledo, Spain</a>, through contributors like <a href="Gerard%20of%20Cremona">Gerard of Cremona</a> and <a href="Adelard%20of%20Bath">Adelard of Bath</a>. Translations of the time included the <a href="Turba%20Philosophorum">Turba Philosophorum</a>, and the works of <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> and <a href="al-Razi">al-Razi</a>. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.

Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. The 11th-century <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">St Anselm</a> put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. In the early 12th century, <a href="Peter%20Abelard">Peter Abelard</a> followed Anselm's work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. In the early 13th century, <a href="Robert%20Grosseteste">Robert Grosseteste</a> used Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.

Through much of the 12th and 13th centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered on translations, and new Latin contributions were not made. The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. In the 13th century, <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a> were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms. Albertus Magnus, a <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican monk</a>, is known to have written works such as the "Book of Minerals" where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist. Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert's student <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>.

Roger Bacon, a <a href="Franciscan%20Order">Franciscan monk</a> who wrote on a wide variety of topics including <a href="optics">optics</a>, <a href="comparative%20linguistics">comparative linguistics</a>, and medicine, composed his "<a href="Opus%20Majus">Great Work</a>" () for as part of a project towards rebuilding the <a href="medieval%20university">medieval university</a> curriculum to include the new learning of his time. While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy's connections to <a href="soteriology">soteriology</a> and Christian theology. Bacon's writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy. Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical, however, confirmed the theoretical thought experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine. In later European legend, however, Bacon became an archmage. In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a <a href="brazen%20head">brazen head</a> capable of answering its owner's questions.

Soon after Bacon, the influential work of <a href="Pseudo-Geber">Pseudo-Geber</a> (sometimes identified as <a href="Paul%20of%20Taranto">Paul of Taranto</a>) appeared. His "Summa Perfectionis" remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described. By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the <a href="soul">human soul</a>). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded <a href="jargon">jargon</a> set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made <a href="observation">observation</a>s and <a href="theory">theories</a> about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.

In the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars. Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves. <a href="Dante">Dante</a>, <a href="Piers%20Plowman">Piers Plowman</a>, and <a href="Chaucer">Chaucer</a> all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars. <a href="Pope%20John%20XXII">Pope John XXII</a>'s 1317 edict, "<a href="Spondent%20quas%20non%20exhibent">Spondent quas non exhibent</a>" forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists. In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV). These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone. The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of <a href="Petrus%20Bonus">Petrus Bonus</a>, <a href="John%20of%20Rupescissa">John of Rupescissa</a>, and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.

<a href="Nicolas%20Flamel">Nicolas Flamel</a> is a well-known alchemist, but a good example of <a href="pseudepigraphy">pseudepigraphy</a>, the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Although the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612. Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the <a href="philosopher%27s%20stone">philosopher's stone</a>. His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone. Through the <a href="late%20Middle%20Ages">14th and 15th centuries</a>, alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. <a href="Bernard%20Trevisan">Bernard Trevisan</a> and <a href="George%20Ripley%20%28alchemist%29">George Ripley</a> made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.

During the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy. The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.

In the late 15th century, <a href="Marsilo%20Ficino">Marsilo Ficino</a> translated the <a href="Corpus%20Hermeticum">Corpus Hermeticum</a> and the works of Plato into Latin. These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent. <a href="Renaissance%20Humanism">Renaissance Humanism</a> and <a href="Renaissance%20Neoplatonism">Renaissance Neoplatonism</a> guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.

Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala. A key figure in this development was German <a href="Heinrich%20Cornelius%20Agrippa">Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa</a> (1486–1535), who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists. In his "De Occulta Philosophia", he attempted to merge <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, Hermeticism, and alchemy. He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.

Philippus Aureolus <a href="Paracelsus">Paracelsus</a>, (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippa's occultism and moving away from <a href="chrysopoeia">chrysopoeia</a>. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote, "Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines."

His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them. Paracelsian practical alchemy, especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named <a href="spagyric">spagyric</a> (a synonym for alchemy from the Greek words meaning "to separate" and "to join together", based on the Latin alchemic maxim: "solve et coagula"). <a href="Iatrochemistry">Iatrochemistry</a> also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus.

<a href="John%20Dee">John Dee</a> (13 July 1527 – December, 1608) followed Agrippa's occult tradition. Although better known for angel summoning, divination, and his role as <a href="astrologer">astrologer</a>, cryptographer, and consultant to <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, Dee's alchemical "Monas Hieroglyphica", written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work. His writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the Hermetic axiom "As above so below". During the 17th century, a short-lived "supernatural" interpretation of alchemy became popular, including support by fellows of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>: <a href="Robert%20Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> and <a href="Elias%20Ashmole">Elias Ashmole</a>. Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the <a href="philosopher%27s%20stone">philosopher's stone</a> might be used to summon and communicate with angels.

Entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe. Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones. <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate <a href="Edward%20Kelley">Edward Kelley</a>. <a href="James%20IV%20of%20Scotland">King James IV of Scotland</a>, <a href="Julius%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, <a href="Augustus%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony">Augustus, Elector of Saxony</a>, <a href="Julius%20Echter%20von%20Mespelbrunn">Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn</a>, and <a href="Maurice%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel</a> all contracted alchemists. John's son <a href="Arthur%20Dee">Arthur Dee</a> worked as a court physician to <a href="Michael%20I%20of%20Russia">Michael I of Russia</a> and <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I of England</a> but also compiled the alchemical book "<a href="Fasciculus%20Chemicus">Fasciculus Chemicus</a>".

Although most of these appointments were legitimate, the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance. "Betrüger" would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage. Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as <a href="Michael%20Maier">Michael Maier</a> and <a href="Heinrich%20Khunrath">Heinrich Khunrath</a> wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the <a href="con%20artist">con artist</a>s. False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.

The terms "chemia" and "alchemia" were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> (1546–1601), an alchemist better known for his <a href="astronomical">astronomical</a> and <a href="astrological">astrological</a> investigations, had a laboratory built at his <a href="Uraniborg">Uraniborg</a> observatory/research institute. <a href="Micha%C5%82%20S%C4%99dziw%C3%B3j">Michael Sendivogius</a> ("Michał Sędziwój", 1566–1636), a <a href="Poland">Polish</a> alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to <a href="Cornelius%20Drebbel">Cornelius Drebbel</a> who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see <a href="Isaac%20Newton%27s%20occult%20studies">Isaac Newton's occult studies</a>) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include <a href="Robert%20Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>, and <a href="Jan%20Baptist%20van%20Helmont">Jan Baptist van Helmont</a>. Their Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.

The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for "ancient wisdom". Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century. As late as 1781 <a href="James%20Price%20%28chemist%29">James Price</a> claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold. Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: "Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian, Paracelsian and anti-Paracelsian, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof."

<a href="Robert%20Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> (1627–1691) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant. This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Lavoisier</a> and <a href="John%20Dalton">John Dalton</a>.

Beginning around 1720, a rigid distinction was drawn between "alchemy" and "chemistry" for the first time. By the 1740s, "alchemy" was now restricted to the realm of gold making, leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud. In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to divorce and separate the "new" chemistry from the "old" practices of alchemy. This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, and even to the present day.

During the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science. The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience. This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.

In the 19th-century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were <a href="Mary%20Anne%20Atwood">Mary Anne Atwood</a> and <a href="Ethan%20A.%20Hitchcock%20%28general%29">Ethan Allen Hitchcock</a>, who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: "No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy." Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including <a href="Eliphas%20Levi">Eliphas Levi</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Edward%20Waite">Arthur Edward Waite</a>, and <a href="Rudolf%20Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a>. Hitchcock, in his "Remarks Upon Alchymists" (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron <a href="Carl%20Reichenbach">Carl Reichenbach</a>, published his studies on <a href="Odic%20force">Odic force</a>, a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.

Several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy. <a href="Michael%20Maier">Michael Maier</a> names <a href="Mary%20the%20Jewess">Mary the Jewess</a>, <a href="Cleopatra%20the%20Alchemist">Cleopatra the Alchemist</a>, <a href="Medera">Medera</a>, and <a href="Taphnutia">Taphnutia</a> as the four women who knew how to make the philosopher's stone. Zosimos' sister Theosebia (later known as Euthica the Arab) and <a href="Isis%20the%20Prophetess">Isis the Prophetess</a> also played a role in early alchemical texts.

The first alchemist whose name we know is said to have been <a href="Mary%20the%20Jewess">Mary the Jewess</a> (c. 200 A.D.). Early sources claim that Mary (or Maria) devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry. Her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes. The laboratory water-bath, known eponymously (especially in France) as the <a href="bain-marie">bain-marie</a>, is said to have been invented or at least improved by her. Essentially a double-boiler, it was (and is) used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating. The tribikos (a modified distillation apparatus) and the kerotakis (a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her. The occasional claim that Mary was the first to discover hydrochloric acid is not accepted by most authorities. Although we have no writing from Mary herself, she is known from the early-fourth-century writings of <a href="Zosimos%20of%20Panopolis">Zosimos of Panopolis</a>.

Due to the proliferation of <a href="pseudepigrapha">pseudepigrapha</a> and anonymous works, it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women. After the Greco-Roman period, women's names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature. Women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods, aside from the fictitious account of <a href="Perenelle%20Flamel">Perenelle Flamel</a>. <a href="Mary%20Anne%20Atwood">Mary Anne Atwood</a>'s "A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery" (1850) marks their return during the nineteenth-century occult revival.

The history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study. As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, <a href="Kabbalah">kabbalism</a>, <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a>, <a href="Rosicrucianism">Rosicrucianism</a>, and other mystic movements. Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Exeter">University of Exeter</a> Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), the <a href="European%20Society%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Western%20Esotericism">European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism</a> (ESSWE), and the <a href="University%20of%20Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</a>'s Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents. A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the <a href="Bibliotheca%20Philosophica%20Hermetica">Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica</a> in Amsterdam. A recipe found in a mid-19th-century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold. The author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located.

Journals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include '<a href="Ambix">Ambix</a>', published by the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry, and '<a href="Isis%20%28journal%29">Isis</a>', published by The History of Science Society.

Western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born. Concepts were imported from <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a> and earlier Greek <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a>. As such, the <a href="Classical%20elements">Classical elements</a> appear in alchemical writings, as do the seven <a href="Classical%20planets">Classical planets</a> and the corresponding seven <a href="metals%20of%20antiquity">metals of antiquity</a>. Similarly, the gods of the Roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature. The concepts of <a href="prima%20materia">prima materia</a> and <a href="anima%20mundi">anima mundi</a> are central to the theory of the <a href="philosopher%27s%20stone">philosopher's stone</a>.

In the eyes of a variety of esoteric and <a href="Hermeticism">Hermetic</a> practitioners, alchemy is fundamentally spiritual. Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection. The writings attributed to <a href="Hermes%20Trismegistus">Hermes Trismegistus</a> are a primary source of alchemical theory. He is named "alchemy's founder and chief patron, authority, inspiration and guide".

Early alchemists, such as <a href="Zosimos%20of%20Panopolis">Zosimos of Panopolis</a> (c. AD 300), highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul. This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as metaphors for <a href="spirit">spirit</a>ual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true <a href="spiritual%20philosophy">spiritual philosophy</a>. Practitioners and patrons such as <a href="Melchior%20Cibinensis">Melchior Cibinensis</a> and <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20VIII">Pope Innocent VIII</a> existed within the ranks of the church, while <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings. Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic <a href="alchemical%20symbol">alchemical symbol</a>s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.

In his 1766 "Alchemical Catechism", Théodore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic:

The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.


Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations. Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science <a href="Lawrence%20M.%20Principe">Lawrence M. Principe</a> and <a href="William%20R.%20Newman">William R. Newman</a>, have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts. At the opposite end of the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian and Anna Marie Roos, who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.

Today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from <a href="New%20Age">New Age</a> or radical environmentalism movements. Groups like the <a href="Rosicrucianism">Rosicrucians</a> and <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasons</a> have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism. Since the Victorian revival of alchemy, "occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances.", which has contributed to a merger of <a href="magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a> and alchemy in popular thought.

Traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques. In <a href="Ayurveda">Ayurveda</a>, the <a href="Samskara%20%28Ayurvedic%29">samskaras</a> are claimed to transform <a href="heavy%20metals">heavy metals</a> and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.

Spagyrists of the 20th century, <a href="Frater%20Albertus">Albert Richard Riedel</a> and Jean Dubuis, merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods. The schools they founded, "Les Philosophes de la Nature" and "The Paracelsus Research Society", popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products. The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a New Age medicinal practice.

Alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Gustav Jung</a>. Initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images, after being given a copy of the translation of "The Secret of the Golden Flower", a Chinese alchemical text, by his friend Richard Wilhelm, Jung discovered a direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner, symbolic images coming up in dreams, visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients. A process, which he called "process of individuation". He regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this "process of <a href="individuation">individuation</a>" of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal. Together with his alchemical "mystica soror", Jungian Swiss analyst <a href="Marie-Louise%20von%20Franz">Marie-Louise von Franz</a>, Jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available, compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross-references and pored over them. The volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the "<a href="hieros%20gamos">hieros gamos</a>" or divine marriage. His writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams, symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces (<a href="Jungian%20archetypes">archetypes</a>) that influence all of life.

Both von Franz and Jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture. Jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, "<a href="Mysterium%20Coniunctionis">Mysterium Conuinctionis</a>."

Alchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. "Literary alchemy" appears throughout the history of English literature from <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> to <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>, and also the popular Japanese manga <a href="Full%20Metal%20Alchemist">Full Metal Alchemist</a>. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of Terry Pratchett.

Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.

Astronomer

An astronomer is a <a href="scientist">scientist</a> in the field of <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. They observe <a href="astronomical%20object">astronomical object</a>s such as <a href="star">star</a>s, <a href="planet">planet</a>s, <a href="natural%20satellite">moons</a>, <a href="comet">comet</a>s, and <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a> – in either <a href="observational%20astronomy">observational</a> (by analyzing the data) or <a href="theoretical%20astronomy">theoretical astronomy</a>. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include <a href="planetary%20science">planetary science</a>, solar astronomy, the origin or <a href="stellar%20evolution">evolution of stars</a>, or the <a href="galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution">formation of galaxies</a>. Related but distinct subjects like <a href="physical%20cosmology">physical cosmology</a>, which studies the <a href="Universe">Universe</a> as a whole.

Astronomers usually fall under either of two main types: observational and <a href="scientific%20theory">theoretical</a>. Observational astronomers make direct <a href="observation">observation</a>s of celestial objects and analyze the data. In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate <a href="Conceptual%20model">model</a>s of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die. They use these data to create models or <a href="simulation">simulation</a>s to theorize how different celestial objects work.

Further subcategories under these two main <a href="branches%20of%20science">branches</a> of astronomy include planetary astronomy, <a href="galactic%20astronomy">galactic astronomy</a>, or physical cosmology.

<a href="History%20of%20astronomy">Historically</a>, astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of <a href="phenomena">phenomena</a> in the sky, while <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a> attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms "astronomer" and "astrophysicist" are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> in <a href="physics">physics</a> or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities. They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.

The number of professional astronomers in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> is actually quite small. The <a href="American%20Astronomical%20Society">American Astronomical Society</a>, which is the major organization of professional astronomers in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, <a href="geology">geology</a>, and <a href="engineering">engineering</a>, whose research interests are closely related to astronomy. The <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the Ph.D. level and beyond.
Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a <a href="telescope">telescope</a> through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a> (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the <a href="light">light</a> is added over time. Before CCDs, <a href="photographic%20plates">photographic plates</a> were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers' time.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes <a href="planetarium">planetarium</a>s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.

Those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths, sciences and computing in high school. Taking courses that teach how to research, write and present papers are also invaluable. In college/university most astronomers get a Ph.D. in astronomy or physics.

While there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among <a href="amateurs">amateurs</a>. Most cities have <a href="amateur%20astronomy">amateur astronomy</a> clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host <a href="star%20party">star parties</a>. The <a href="Astronomical%20Society%20of%20the%20Pacific">Astronomical Society of the Pacific</a> is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations. Like any <a href="hobby">hobby</a>, most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to <a href="stargazing">stargazing</a> and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called "armchair astronomers" to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

ASCII

ASCII ( ), abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a <a href="character%20encoding">character encoding</a> standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, <a href="telecommunications%20equipment">telecommunications equipment</a>, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

ASCII is the traditional name for the encoding system; the <a href="Internet%20Assigned%20Numbers%20Authority">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a> (IANA) prefers the updated name US-ASCII, which clarifies that this system was developed in the US and based on the typographical symbols predominantly in use there.

ASCII is one of the <a href="List%20of%20IEEE%20milestones">IEEE milestones</a>.

ASCII was developed from <a href="telegraph%20code">telegraph code</a>. Its first commercial use was as a seven-<a href="bit">bit</a> <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> code promoted by Bell data services. Work on the ASCII standard began on October 6, 1960, with the first meeting of the <a href="American%20Standards%20Association">American Standards Association</a>'s (ASA) (now the <a href="American%20National%20Standards%20Institute">American National Standards Institute</a> or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published in 1963, underwent a major revision during 1967, and experienced its most recent update during 1986. Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters.

Originally based on the <a href="English%20alphabet">English alphabet</a>, ASCII encodes 128 specified <a href="character%20%28computing%29">characters</a> into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart above. Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable: these include the digits "0" to "9", lowercase letters "a" to "z", uppercase letters "A" to "Z", and <a href="punctuation%20symbol">punctuation symbol</a>s. In addition, the original ASCII specification included 33 non-printing <a href="control%20code">control code</a>s which originated with <a href="Teletype%20machine">Teletype machine</a>s; most of these are now obsolete, although a few are still commonly used, such as the <a href="carriage%20return">carriage return</a>, <a href="line%20feed">line feed</a> and <a href="Tab%20key%23Tab%20characters">tab</a> codes.

For example, lowercase "<a href="i">i</a>" would be represented in the ASCII encoding by <a href="binary%20number">binary</a> 1101001 = <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> 69 ("i" is the ninth letter) = <a href="decimal">decimal</a> 105.

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the <a href="American%20Standards%20Association">American Standards Association</a> (ASA), called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group (now <a href="INCITS">INCITS</a>). The ASA became the <a href="United%20States%20of%20America%20Standards%20Institute">United States of America Standards Institute</a> (USASI) and ultimately the <a href="American%20National%20Standards%20Institute">American National Standards Institute</a> (ANSI).

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code. There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet. The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to "sticks" 6 and 7, and <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard. The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting. Locating the lowercase letters in "sticks" 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified <a href="case-insensitive">case-insensitive</a> character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the <a href="brace%20%28punctuation%29">brace</a> and <a href="vertical%20bar">vertical bar</a> characters), renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed). ASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3.4-1967, then USAS X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986.

Revisions of the ASCII standard:


In the X3.15 standard, the X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted (<a href="least%20significant%20bit">least significant bit</a> first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a <a href="9-track">9-track</a> standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some <a href="punched%20card">punched card</a> formats.

The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> encoding systems. Like other <a href="character%20encoding">character encoding</a>s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and <a href="character%20%28computing%29">character</a> symbols (i.e. <a href="grapheme">grapheme</a>s and <a href="control%20character">control character</a>s). This allows <a href="Digital%20data">digital</a> devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 <a href="English%20alphabet">alphabetic</a> characters, 10 <a href="numerical%20digit">numerical digit</a>s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the <a href="CCITT">Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique</a> (CCITT) <a href="International%20Telegraph%20Alphabet%20No.%202">International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2</a> (ITA2) standard of 1924, <a href="FIELDATA">FIELDATA</a> (1956), and early <a href="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a> (1963), more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.

ITA2 were in turn based on the 5-bit telegraph code <a href="%C3%89mile%20Baudot">Émile Baudot</a> invented in 1870 and patented in 1874.

The committee debated the possibility of a <a href="Shift%20code">shift</a> function (like in <a href="ITA2">ITA2</a>), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a <a href="six-bit%20character%20code">six-bit code</a>. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for <a href="data%20transmission">data transmission</a>, as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.

The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits (<a href="octet%20%28computing%29">octet</a>s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with <a href="binary-coded%20decimal">binary-coded decimal</a>. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a <a href="parity%20bit">parity bit</a> for <a href="error%20checking">error checking</a> if desired. <a href="Eight-bit">Eight-bit</a> machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0. In some printers, the high bit was used to enable <a href="Italics">Italics</a> printing.

The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two so called "ASCII sticks" (32 positions) were reserved for control characters. The <a href="Space%20%28punctuation%29">"space" character</a> had to come before graphics to make <a href="sorting%20algorithm">sorting</a> easier, so it became position 20; for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. The committee decided it was important to support <a href="upper%20case">uppercase</a> <a href="sixbit%20code%20pages">64-character alphabets</a>, and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes, as was done in the <a href="DEC%20SIXBIT">DEC SIXBIT</a> code (1963). <a href="Lower%20case">Lowercase</a> letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase. To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter "A" was placed in position 41 to match the draft of the corresponding British standard. The digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining <a href="Nibble">4 bits</a> correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with <a href="binary-coded%20decimal">binary-coded decimal</a> straightforward.

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on "mechanical" typewriters, not "electric" typewriters. Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted "0" and "1", using "O" (capital letter "o") and "l" (lowercase letter "L") instead, but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII codice_5 were placed in the second stick, positions 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick. The parentheses could not correspond to "9" and "0", however, because the place corresponding to "0" was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing codice_6 (underscore) from "6" and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with "8" and "9". This discrepancy from typewriters led to <a href="bit-paired%20keyboard">bit-paired keyboard</a>s, notably the <a href="Teletype%20Model%2033">Teletype Model 33</a>, which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the <a href="IBM%20Selectric">IBM Selectric</a> (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> (1981), especially <a href="Model%20M">Model M</a> (1984) and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The codice_7 pair also dates to the No. 2, and the codice_8 pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift codice_9 (comma) or codice_10 (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the codice_11 pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly codice_12) to codice_13.

Some common characters were not included, notably codice_14, while codice_15 were included as diacritics for international use, and codice_16 for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters codice_17 (in addition to common codice_18). The "@" symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented "À" in the French variation, so the "@" was placed in position 40, right before the letter A.

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), <a href="End%20of%20Message">end of message</a> (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), "who are you?" (WRU), "are you?" (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the <a href="Hamming%20distance">Hamming distance</a> between their bit patterns.

ASCII-code order is also called "ASCIIbetical" order. <a href="Collation">Collation</a> of data is sometimes done in this order rather than "standard" alphabetical order (<a href="collating%20sequence">collating sequence</a>). The main deviations in ASCII order are:

An intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.

ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for <a href="control%20character">control character</a>s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as <a href="computer%20printer">printers</a>) that make use of ASCII, or to provide <a href="Metadata">meta-information</a> about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.

For example, character 10 represents the "line feed" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents "backspace". refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or <a href="Whitespace%20%28computer%20science%29">white space</a> as non-whitespace control characters. Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as <a href="markup%20language">markup language</a>s, address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a <a href="data%20stream">data stream</a>, and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of "delete".

Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the <a href="Teletype%20Model%2033">Teletype Model 33</a> ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available <a href="punched%20tape">paper tape</a> reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (<a href="Delete%20key">Delete</a>) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of <a href="underscore">underscore</a>), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as "delete previous character" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, "transmit on") caused the tape reader to resume. This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a "handshaking" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output. The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively.

The Teletype could not move the head backwards, so it did not put a key on the keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead there was a key marked "rubout" that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a hand-typed paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored. Teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, so these systems had to use the available key and thus the DEL code to erase the previous character. Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL code for the key marked "Backspace" while the key marked "Delete" sent an escape sequence, while many other terminals sent BS for the Backspace key. The Unix terminal driver could only use one code to back up, this could be set to BS "or" DEL, but not both, resulting in a very long period of annoyance where you had to correct it depending on what terminal you were using (modern shells using <a href="readline">readline</a> understand both codes). The assumption that no key sent a BS caused Control+H to be used for other purposes, such as a "help" command in Emacs.

Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The "escape" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of "escape" encountered in URL encodings, <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C language</a> strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called "<a href="ANSI%20escape%20code">ANSI escape code</a>" (or, more properly, a "<a href="Control%20Sequence%20Introducer">Control Sequence Introducer</a>") from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with ESC followed by a "<nowiki>[</nowiki>" (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an <a href="out-of-band%20data">out-of-band</a> character used to terminate an operation, as in the <a href="Text%20Editor%20and%20Corrector">TECO</a> and <a href="vi">vi</a> <a href="text%20editor">text editor</a>s. In <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a> (GUI) and <a href="window%20%28computing%29">windowing</a> systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to <a href="exit%20%28system%20call%29">exit</a> (terminate) altogether.

The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring "plain text" files between systems. The best example of this is the <a href="newline">newline</a> problem on various <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both "Carriage Return" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and "Line Feed" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name "Carriage Return" comes from the fact that on a manual <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a> the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary. The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.

<a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">DEC</a> operating systems (<a href="OS/8">OS/8</a>, <a href="RT-11">RT-11</a>, <a href="RSX-11">RSX-11</a>, <a href="RSTS/E">RSTS</a>, <a href="TOPS-10">TOPS-10</a>, etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally <a href="Teleprinter">Teletype machines</a>) would work. By the time so-called "glass TTYs" (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When <a href="Gary%20Kildall">Gary Kildall</a> created <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">DEC</a>'s <a href="RT-11">RT-11</a>. Until the introduction of <a href="PC%20DOS">PC DOS</a> in 1981, <a href="IBM">IBM</a> had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM's <a href="PC%20DOS">PC DOS</a> (also marketed as <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a>, and <a href="Windows">Windows</a> inherited it from MS-DOS.

Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters <a href="plain%20text">plain text</a> data streams, including files, on <a href="Multics">Multics</a> used line feed (LF) alone as a line terminator. <a href="Unix">Unix</a> and <a href="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> systems, and <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original <a href="Macintosh%20OS">Macintosh OS</a>, <a href="Apple%20DOS">Apple DOS</a>, and <a href="ProDOS">ProDOS</a>, on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced these operating systems with the Unix-based <a href="macOS">macOS</a> operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well. The Radio Shack <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> also used a lone CR to terminate lines.

Computers attached to the <a href="ARPANET">ARPANET</a> included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and <a href="TOPS-20%23TENEX">TENEX</a> using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as <a href="OS/360">OS/360</a> that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used <a href="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a> rather than ASCII. The <a href="Telnet">Telnet</a> protocol defined an ASCII "<a href="Network%20Virtual%20Terminal">Network Virtual Terminal</a>" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT. The <a href="File%20Transfer%20Protocol">File Transfer Protocol</a> adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode. This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVT's CR-LF line-ending convention.

The PDP-6 monitor, and its PDP-10 successor TOPS-10, used Control-Z (SUB) as an end-of-file indication for input from a terminal. Some operating systems such as CP/M tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z to mark the end of the actual text in the file. For these reasons, EOF, or <a href="end-of-file">end-of-file</a>, was used colloquially and conventionally as a <a href="three-letter%20acronym">three-letter acronym</a> for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute. The end-of-text code (<a href="End-of-text%20character">ETX</a>), also known as <a href="Control-C">Control-C</a>, was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient <a href="Mnemonic%20device">mnemonic aid</a>. A historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.

In C library and <a href="Unix">Unix</a> conventions, the <a href="null%20character">null character</a> is used to terminate text <a href="string%20%28computer%20science%29">strings</a>; such <a href="null-terminated%20string">null-terminated string</a>s can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for "zero".

Other representations might be used by specialist equipment, for example <a href="ISO%202047">ISO 2047</a> graphics or <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> numbers.

Codes 20 to 7E, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, <a href="punctuation%20mark">punctuation mark</a>s, and a few miscellaneous symbols. There are 95 printable characters in total.

Code 20, the <a href="Space%20%28punctuation%29">"space" character</a>, denotes the space between words, as produced by the space bar of a keyboard. Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section.

Code 7F corresponds to the non-printable "delete" (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section's chart. Earlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the <a href="caret">caret</a> (5E) and the left arrow instead of the <a href="underscore">underscore</a> (5F).

ASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for <a href="American%20Telephone%20%26amp%3B%20Telegraph">American Telephone & Telegraph</a>'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit <a href="ITA2">ITA2</a>, which was also used by the competing <a href="Telex">Telex</a> teleprinter system. <a href="Robert%20William%20Bemer">Bob Bemer</a> introduced features such as the <a href="Escape%20character">escape sequence</a>. His British colleague <a href="Hugh%20McGregor%20Ross">Hugh McGregor Ross</a> helped to popularize this work according to Bemer, "so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the "Bemer-Ross Code" in Europe". Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called "the father of ASCII".
On March 11, 1968, U.S. President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:
I have also approved recommendations of the <a href="Secretary%20of%20Commerce">Secretary of Commerce</a> regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the <a href="Federal%20Government">Federal Government</a> inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.

ASCII was the most common character encoding on the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a> until December 2007, when <a href="UTF-8">UTF-8</a> encoding surpassed it; UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII.

As computer technology spread throughout the world, different <a href="Standardization">standards bodies</a> and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as "<a href="ASCII%20extension">ASCII extension</a>s", although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.

From early in its development, ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.
Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as <a href="ISO%20646">ISO 646</a> (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a> and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's <a href="pound%20sterling">pound sterling</a> (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.

Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. <a href="%C3%A9">é</a>, <a href="%C3%B1">ñ</a>, <a href="%C3%9F">ß</a>, <a href="%C5%81">Ł</a>), currency symbols (e.g. <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>, <a href="%C2%A5">¥</a>), etc. See also <a href="YUSCII">YUSCII</a> (Yugoslavia).

It would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several <a href="code%20point">code point</a>s reserved for "national use". However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to "national use" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as

instead of

<a href="C%20trigraph">C trigraph</a>s were created to solve this problem for <a href="ANSI%20C">ANSI C</a>, although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a>) contained "{, }" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get "N{ jag har sm|rg}sar" as the answer, which should be "Nä jag har smörgåsar" meaning "No I've got sandwiches".

Eventually, as 8-, <a href="16-bit">16-</a> and <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> (and later <a href="64-bit">64-bit</a>) computers began to replace <a href="12-bit">12-</a>, <a href="18-bit">18-</a> and <a href="36-bit">36-bit</a> computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.

Encodings include <a href="ISCII">ISCII</a> (India), <a href="VISCII">VISCII</a> (Vietnam). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.

Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. <a href="Kaypro">Kaypro</a> <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> computers used the "upper" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet.

The <a href="PETSCII">PETSCII</a> code <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore International</a> used for their <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum%20character%20set">ZX Spectrum</a> computer. <a href="ATASCII">Atari</a> 8-bit computers and <a href="Galaksija%20%28computer%29%23Character%20ROM">Galaksija</a> computers also used ASCII variants.

The IBM PC defined <a href="code%20page%20437">code page 437</a>, which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as <a href="Emoticon">smiley faces</a>, and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as <a href="DOS">DOS</a> supported these code pages, and manufacturers of <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>s supported them in hardware. <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> developed the <a href="Multinational%20Character%20Set">Multinational Character Set</a> (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular <a href="VT220">VT220</a> <a href="computer%20terminal">terminal</a> as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined <a href="Mac%20OS%20Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.

The <a href="ISO/IEC%208859">ISO/IEC 8859</a> standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, <a href="Windows-1252">Windows-1252</a> (often mislabeled as <a href="ISO-8859-1">ISO-8859-1</a>), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing. ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when <a href="UTF-8">UTF-8</a> became more common.

ISO/IEC 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.

<a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> and the ISO/IEC 10646 <a href="Universal%20Character%20Set">Universal Character Set</a> (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s called "code points") and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called <a href="UTF-8">UTF-8</a>, <a href="UTF-16">UTF-16</a> and <a href="UTF-32">UTF-32</a>).

ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows <a href="UTF-8">UTF-8</a> to be <a href="Backward%20compatibility">backward compatible</a> with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters. Even more importantly, <a href="forward%20compatibility">forward compatibility</a> is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.

Animation

Animation is a method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In <a href="traditional%20animation">traditional animation</a>, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent <a href="cel">celluloid sheets</a> to be photographed and exhibited on <a href="film">film</a>. Today most animations are made with <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> (CGI). <a href="Computer%20animation">Computer animation</a> can be very detailed <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D animation</a>, while <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D computer animation</a> can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> technique to two and three-dimensional objects like <a href="cutout%20animation">paper cutouts</a>, <a href="puppet">puppet</a>s or <a href="Clay%20animation">clay figures</a>. The stop motion technique where live actors are used as a frame-by-frame subject is known as <a href="pixilation">pixilation</a>.

Commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the <a href="phi%20phenomenon">phi phenomenon</a> and <a href="beta%20movement">beta movement</a>, but the exact causes are still uncertain. 
<a href="Analog%20device">Analog</a> mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the <a href="phenakistiscope">phénakisticope</a>, <a href="zoetrope">zoetrope</a>, <a href="flip%20book">flip book</a>, <a href="praxinoscope">praxinoscope</a> and film. <a href="Television">Television</a> and <a href="video">video</a> are popular electronic animation media that originally were <a href="analog%20device">analog</a> and now operate <a href="digital%20media">digitally</a>. For display on the computer, techniques like <a href="animated%20GIF">animated GIF</a> and <a href="Flash%20animation">Flash animation</a> were developed.

Apart from <a href="short%20films">short films</a>, <a href="feature%20films">feature films</a>, animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display moving images, animation is also heavily used for <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s, <a href="motion%20graphics">motion graphics</a> and <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s.

The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics in for instance the moving images in <a href="magic%20lantern">magic lantern</a> shows can also be considered animation. Mechanical animation of actual robotic devices is known as <a href="animatronics">animatronics</a>.

<a href="Animator">Animator</a>s are artists who specialize in creating animation.

The word "animation" stems from the Latin "animationem" (nominative "animatio"), noun of action from past participle stem of "animare", meaning "the action of imparting life". The primary meaning of the English word is "liveliness" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of "moving image medium".

The history of animation started long before the development of <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a>. Humans have probably attempted to depict motion as far back as the <a href="paleolithic">paleolithic</a> period. <a href="Shadow%20play">Shadow play</a> and the <a href="magic%20lantern">magic lantern</a> offered popular shows with moving images as the result of manipulation by hand and/or some minor mechanics.

A 5,200-year old pottery bowl discovered in <a href="Shahr-e%20Sukhteh">Shahr-e Sukhteh</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, has five sequential images painted around it that seem to show phases of a goat leaping up to nip at a tree. In 1833, the <a href="phenakistiscope">phenakistiscope</a> introduced the <a href="stroboscope">stroboscopic</a> principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the <a href="zoetrope">zoetrope</a> (1866), the <a href="flip%20book">flip book</a> (1868), the <a href="praxinoscope">praxinoscope</a> (1877) and cinematography.
<a href="Charles-%C3%89mile%20Reynaud">Charles-Émile Reynaud</a> further developed his projection praxinoscope into the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Optique">Théâtre Optique</a> with transparent hand-painted colorful pictures in a long perforated strip wound between two spools, patented in December 1888. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500.000 visitors at the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20Gr%C3%A9vin">Musée Grévin</a> in Paris. His "Pantomimes Lumineuses" series of animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet.

When film became a common medium some manufacturers of optical toys adapted small magic lanterns into toy film projectors for short loops of film. By 1902, they were producing many <a href="chromolithography">chromolithography</a> film loops, usually by tracing live-action film footage (much like the later <a href="rotoscoping">rotoscoping</a> technique).

Some early filmmakers, including <a href="J.%20Stuart%20Blackton">J. Stuart Blackton</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Melbourne-Cooper">Arthur Melbourne-Cooper</a>, <a href="Segundo%20de%20Chom%C3%B3n">Segundo de Chomón</a> and <a href="Edwin%20S.%20Porter">Edwin S. Porter</a> experimented with stop-motion animation, possibly since around 1899. Blackton's "The Haunted Hotel" (1907) was the first huge success that baffled audiences with objects apparently moving by themselves and inspired other filmmakers to try the technique for themselves.

J. Stuart Blackton also experimented with animation drawn on blackboards and some <a href="cutout%20animation">cutout animation</a> in "<a href="Humorous%20Phases%20of%20Funny%20Faces">Humorous Phases of Funny Faces</a>" (1906).
In 1908, <a href="%C3%89mile%20Cohl">Émile Cohl</a>'s "<a href="Fantasmagorie%20%281908%20film%29">Fantasmagorie</a>" was released with a white-on-black chalkline look created with <a href="Negative%20%28photography%29">negative prints</a> from black ink drawings on white paper. The film largely consists of a <a href="stick%20figure">stick figure</a> moving about and encountering all kinds of <a href="morphing">morphing</a> objects, including a wine bottle that transforms into a flower.

Inspired by Émile Cohl's stop-motion film "Les allumettes animées [Animated Matches]" (1908), <a href="Ladislas%20Starevich">Ladislas Starevich</a> started making his influential puppet animations in 1910.

<a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a>'s "<a href="Little%20Nemo%20%281911%20film%29">Little Nemo</a>" (1911) showcased very detailed drawings. His "<a href="Gertie%20the%20Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a>" (1914) was an also an early example of character development in drawn animation.

During the 1910s, the production of animated short films typically referred to as "<a href="animated%20cartoon">cartoons</a>", became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters. The most successful producer at the time was <a href="John%20Randolph%20Bray">John Randolph Bray</a>, who, along with animator <a href="Earl%20Hurd">Earl Hurd</a>, patented the <a href="cel%20animation">cel animation</a> process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.

"<a href="El%20Ap%C3%B3stol">El Apóstol</a>" (Spanish: "The Apostle") was a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, and the world's first animated feature film. Unfortunately, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of "El Apóstol", and it is now considered a <a href="lost%20film">lost film</a>.

The earliest extant feature-length animated film is <a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Prince%20Achmed">The Adventures of Prince Achmed</a> (1926) made by director <a href="Lotte%20Reiniger">Lotte Reiniger</a> and her collaborators <a href="Carl%20Koch%20%28director%29">Carl Koch</a> and <a href="Berthold%20Bartosch">Berthold Bartosch</a>.

In 1932, the first short animated film created entirely with <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> (using red/green/blue photographic filters and three strips of film) was <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s "<a href="Flowers%20and%20Trees">Flowers and Trees</a>", directed by <a href="Burt%20Gillett">Burt Gillett</a>. But, the first feature film that was done with this technique, apart from the movie The Vanities Fair (1935), by Rouben Mamoulian, was "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>", also by Walt Disney.

In 1958, <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> released "<a href="The%20Huckleberry%20Hound%20Show">The Huckleberry Hound Show</a>", the first half hour television program to feature only in animation. <a href="Terrytoons">Terrytoons</a> released "<a href="Tom%20Terrific">Tom Terrific</a>" that same year. Television significantly decreased public attention to the animated shorts being shown in theaters.

<a href="Computer%20animation">Computer animation</a> has become popular since "<a href="Toy%20Story">Toy Story</a>" (1995), the first feature-length animated film completely made using this technique.

In 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion. Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the mid-2010s because well-made animated projects can find audiences across borders and in all <a href="Four-quadrant%20movie">four quadrants</a>. Animated feature-length films returned the highest <a href="gross%20margin">gross margin</a>s (around 52%) of all <a href="film%20genre">film genre</a>s in the 2004–2013 timeframe.

Traditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper. To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called <a href="cel">cel</a>s, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a <a href="rostrum%20camera">rostrum camera</a> onto motion picture film.

The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system. Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects. The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional <a href="35%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20film">35 mm film</a> and newer media with <a href="digital%20video">digital video</a>. The "look" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the <a href="character%20animator">character animator</a>s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years. Some animation producers have used the term "tradigital" (a play on the words "traditional" and "digital") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.

Examples of traditionally animated feature films include "<a href="Pinocchio%20%281940%20film%29">Pinocchio</a>" (United States, 1940), "<a href="Animal%20Farm%20%281954%20film%29">Animal Farm</a>" (United Kingdom, 1954), "<a href="Lucky%20and%20Zorba">Lucky and Zorba</a>" (Italy, 1998), and "<a href="The%20Illusionist%20%282010%20film%29">The Illusionist</a>" (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include "<a href="The%20Lion%20King">The Lion King</a>" (US, 1994), "<a href="The%20Prince%20of%20Egypt">The Prince of Egypt</a>" (US, 1998), "<a href="Akira%20%281988%20film%29">Akira</a>" (Japan, 1988), "<a href="Spirited%20Away">Spirited Away</a>" (Japan, 2001), "<a href="The%20Triplets%20of%20Belleville">The Triplets of Belleville</a>" (France, 2003), and "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20Kells">The Secret of Kells</a>" (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).

Full animation refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement, having a smooth animation. Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios">Walt Disney studio</a> ("<a href="The%20Little%20Mermaid%20%281989%20film%29">The Little Mermaid</a>", "<a href="Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast%20%281991%20film%29">Beauty and the Beast</a>", "<a href="Aladdin%20%281992%20Disney%20film%29">Aladdin</a>", "<a href="The%20Lion%20King">The Lion King</a>") to the more 'cartoon' styles of the <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Cartoons">Warner Bros. animation studio</a>. Many of the <a href="Disney%20animated%20features">Disney animated features</a> are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20NIMH">The Secret of NIMH</a>" (US, 1982), "<a href="The%20Iron%20Giant">The Iron Giant</a>" (US, 1999), and "<a href="Nocturna%20%28Film%29">Nocturna</a>" (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.

<a href="Limited%20animation">Limited animation</a> involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or "skippy" movement animation. Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio <a href="United%20Productions%20of%20America">United Productions of America</a>, limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in "<a href="Gerald%20McBoing-Boing">Gerald McBoing-Boing</a>" (US, 1951), "<a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%281968%20film%29">Yellow Submarine</a>" (UK, 1968), and certain <a href="anime">anime</a> produced in Japan. Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a>, <a href="Filmation">Filmation</a>, and other TV animation studios) and later <a href="the%20Internet">the Internet</a> (<a href="web%20cartoon">web cartoon</a>s).

<a href="Rotoscoping">Rotoscoping</a> is a technique patented by <a href="Max%20Fleischer">Max Fleischer</a> in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame. The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings, as in "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%281978%20film%29">The Lord of the Rings</a>" (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in "<a href="Waking%20Life">Waking Life</a>" (US, 2001) and "<a href="A%20Scanner%20Darkly%20%28film%29">A Scanner Darkly</a>" (US, 2006). Some other examples are "<a href="Fire%20and%20Ice%20%281983%20film%29">Fire and Ice</a>" (US, 1983), "<a href="Heavy%20Metal%20%28film%29">Heavy Metal</a>" (1981), and "<a href="The%20Flowers%20of%20Evil%20%28manga%29">Aku no Hana</a>" (2013).

<a href="Films%20with%20live%20action%20and%20animation">Live-action/animation</a> is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots. One of the earlier uses was in <a href="Koko%20the%20Clown">Koko the Clown</a> when Koko was drawn over live action footage. Other examples include "<a href="Allegro%20Non%20Troppo">Allegro Non Troppo</a>" (Italy, 1976), "<a href="Who%20Framed%20Roger%20Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>" (US, 1988), "<a href="Space%20Jam">Space Jam</a>" (US, 1996) and "<a href="Osmosis%20Jones">Osmosis Jones</a>" (US, 2001).

Stop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement. There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation. Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.



Computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer. 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact. 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.

<a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D animation</a> figures are created or edited on the computer using 2D <a href="Raster%20graphics">bitmap graphics</a> and 2D <a href="vector%20graphics">vector graphics</a>. This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques, <a href="Interpolation">interpolated</a> <a href="morphing">morphing</a>, <a href="onion%20skinning">onion skinning</a> and interpolated rotoscoping.

2D animation has many applications, including <a href="Scanimate">analog computer animation</a>, <a href="Flash%20animation">Flash animation</a>, and <a href="PowerPoint%20animation">PowerPoint animation</a>. <a href="Cinemagraph">Cinemagraph</a>s are <a href="still%20photograph">still photograph</a>s in the form of an <a href="animated%20GIF">animated GIF</a> file of which part is animated.

Final line advection animation is a technique used in 2D animation, to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department. Speaking about using this approach in "<a href="Paperman">Paperman</a>", John Kahrs said that "Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm."

3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator usually starts by creating a 3D <a href="polygon%20mesh">polygon mesh</a> to manipulate. A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces, which give the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment. Sometimes, the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an <a href="Armature%20%28computer%20animation%29">armature</a> that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices. This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement.

Other techniques can be applied, mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects, fire and water simulations. These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.




An animator is an artist who creates a visual sequence (or audio-visual if added sound) of multiple sequential images that generate the illusion of movement, that is, an animation. Animations are currently in many areas of technology and video, such as <a href="Film">cinema</a>, <a href="television">television</a>, <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s or the <a href="internet">internet</a>. Generally, these works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods to create these images depend on the animator and style that one wants to achieve (with images generated by computer, manually ...).

Animators can be divided into animators of characters (artists who are specialized in the movements, dialogue and acting of the characters) and animators of special effects (for example vehicles, machinery or natural phenomena such as water, snow, rain).

The creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of <a href="filmmaking">filmmaking</a>, with certain unique aspects. Traits common to both live-action and animated <a href="Feature%20film">feature-length films</a> are labor-intensity and high production costs.

The most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the <a href="marginal%20cost">marginal cost</a> of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films. It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more <a href="take">take</a> during <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation). It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film. Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where <a href="storyboard%20artist">storyboard artist</a>s develop every single scene through <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).

Another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film. Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.

This problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw <a href="model%20sheet">model sheet</a>s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles. On traditionally animated projects, <a href="maquette">maquette</a>s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.

Unlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film. In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.

Criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films. Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.

As with any other form of media, animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> function. The first winner of the <a href="5th%20Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a> was the short "<a href="Flowers%20and%20Trees">Flowers and Trees</a>", a production by <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Productions">Walt Disney Productions</a>. The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film "<a href="Shrek">Shrek</a>", produced by <a href="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> and <a href="Pacific%20Data%20Images">Pacific Data Images</a>. <a href="Disney">Disney</a>/<a href="Pixar">Pixar</a> have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. The list of both awards can be obtained here:

Several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards: <a href="Africa%20Movie%20Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animation">Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation</a> (since 2008), <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Film">BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film</a> (since 2006), <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Film">César Award for Best Animated Film</a> (since 2011), <a href="Golden%20Rooster%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animation">Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation</a> (since 1981), <a href="Goya%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Film">Goya Award for Best Animated Film</a> (since 1989), <a href="Japan%20Academy%20Prize%20for%20Animation%20of%20the%20Year">Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year</a> (since 2007), <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Film">National Film Award for Best Animated Film</a> (since 2006). Also since 2007, the <a href="Asia%20Pacific%20Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Feature%20Film">Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film</a> has been awarded at the <a href="Asia%20Pacific%20Screen%20Awards">Asia Pacific Screen Awards</a>. Since 2009, the <a href="European%20Film%20Awards">European Film Awards</a> have awarded the <a href="European%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Film">European Film Award for Best Animated Film</a>.
The <a href="Annie%20Award">Annie Award</a> is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:

Apollo

Apollo (<a href="Attic%20Greek">Attic</a>, <a href="Ionic%20Greek">Ionic</a>, and <a href="Homeric%20Greek">Homeric Greek</a>: , "Apollōn" ( ); <a href="Doric%20Greek">Doric</a>: , "Apellōn"; <a href="Arcadocypriot%20Greek">Arcadocypriot</a>: , "Apeilōn"; <a href="Aeolic%20Greek">Aeolic</a>: , "Aploun"; ) is one of the most important and complex of the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian deities</a> in <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20religion">classical Greek</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Roman%20religion">Roman religion</a> and <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman mythology</a>. The ideal of the "<a href="kouros">kouros</a>" (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Leto">Leto</a>, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced <a href="Etruscan%20mythology">Etruscan mythology</a> as "Apulu".

As the patron of <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> ("Pythian Apollo"), Apollo was an <a href="oracular">oracular</a> god—the prophetic <a href="deity">deity</a> of the <a href="Pythia">Delphic Oracle</a>.

Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a>, yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>.

Apollo favors and delights in the foundation of towns and the establishment of civil constitution. Hence is associated with dominion over <a href="Colonies%20in%20antiquity">colonists</a>.

Apollo is the giver and interpreter of laws. He presides over the divine law and custom along with Zeus, Demeter and Themis.

He is the patron defender of herds and flocks. He is also connected with the fertility of cattle.

As the leader of the <a href="Muse">Muse</a>s ("Apollon Musegetes") and director of their choir, Apollo functions as the patron god of music and poetry. <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> created the <a href="lyre">lyre</a> for him, and the instrument became a common <a href="Apollo%23Attributes%20and%20symbols">attribute of Apollo</a>. Hymns sung to Apollo were called <a href="paean">paean</a>s.

Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil. He delivered men from the epidemics. Various epithets call him the "averter of evil".

As an agricultural deity, Apollo protects the crops from diseases, especially the rust in corns and grains. He is also the controller and destroyer of pests that infect plants and plant harvests. 

In Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as "Apollo Helios" he became identified among Greeks with <a href="Helios">Helios</a>, <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> <a href="solar%20deity">god of the sun</a>, and his sister Artemis similarly equated with <a href="Selene">Selene</a>, Titan <a href="lunar%20deity">goddess of the moon</a>. In Latin texts, on the other hand, <a href="Joseph%20Fontenrose">Joseph Fontenrose</a> declared himself unable to find any <a href="conflation">conflation</a> of Apollo with <a href="Sol%20%28mythology%29">Sol</a> among the <a href="Classical%20Latin">Augustan poets</a> of the 1st century, not even in the <a href="conjuration">conjuration</a>s of <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a> and <a href="Latinus">Latinus</a> in "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" XII (161–215). Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.

The name "Apollo"—unlike the related <a href="List%20of%20Mycenaean%20deities">older name</a> "Paean"—is generally not found in the <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> (<a href="Mycenean%20Greek">Mycenean Greek</a>) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the <a href="Lacuna%20%28manuscripts%29">lacunose</a> form "]pe-rjo-[" (Linear B: ]-[) on the <a href="Knossos">KN</a> E 842 tablet.

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the name is uncertain. The spelling ( in <a href="Attic%20Greek">Classical Attic</a>) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the <a href="common%20era">common era</a>, but the <a href="Dorians">Doric</a> form, "Apellon" (), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier . It probably is a cognate to the Doric month "Apellaios" (), and the offerings <a href="apellaia">apellaia</a> () at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival <a href="apellai">apellai</a> (). 
According to some scholars, the words are derived from the Doric word "apella" (), which originally meant "wall," "fence for animals" and later "assembly within the limits of the square." <a href="Apella">Apella</a> () is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta, corresponding to the "<a href="Ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Athens%29">ecclesia</a>" (). <a href="Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes">R. S. P. Beekes</a> rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun "apellai" and suggested a <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> proto-form *"Apalun".

Several instances of <a href="popular%20etymology">popular etymology</a> are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb ("apollymi"), "to destroy". <a href="Plato">Plato</a> in "<a href="Cratylus">Cratylus</a>" connects the name with ("apolysis"), "redemption", with ("apolousis"), "purification", and with ("[h]aploun"), "simple", in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, , and finally with ("aeiballon"), "ever-shooting". <a href="Hesychius%20of%20Alexandria">Hesychius</a> connects the name Apollo with the Doric ("apella"), which means "assembly", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation ("sekos"), "fold", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds. In the <a href="ancient%20Macedonian%20language">ancient Macedonian language</a> ("pella") means "stone," and some <a href="toponyms">toponyms</a> may be derived from this word: (<a href="Pella">Pella</a>, the capital of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">ancient Macedonia</a>) and ("Pellēnē"/"<a href="Pallini">Pallene</a>").

A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name, The <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite</a> form "<a href="Apaliunas">Apaliunas</a>" ("") is attested in the <a href="Manapa-Tarhunta%20letter">Manapa-Tarhunta letter</a>, perhaps related to <a href="Hurrian">Hurrian</a> (and certainly the <a href="List%20of%20Etruscan%20mythological%20figures">Etruscan</a>) "<a href="Aplu%20%28deity%29">Aplu</a>", a god of plague, in turn likely from <a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a> "Aplu Enlil" meaning simply "the son of <a href="Enlil">Enlil</a>", a title that was given to the god <a href="Nergal">Nergal</a>, who was linked to <a href="Shamash">Shamash</a>, Babylonian god of the sun.
The role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of <a href="Apollo%20Smintheus">Apollo Smintheus</a> ("mouse Apollo") by Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is <a href="apotropaic">apotropaic</a>, meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague).

The <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite</a> testimony reflects an early form "", which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot with Doric . The name of the Lydian god "Qλdãns" /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y ">" d. Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric "Ἀπέλjων" and Hittite "Apaliunas".

A <a href="Luwian%20language">Luwian</a> etymology suggested for "Apaliunas" makes Apollo "The One of Entrapment", perhaps in the sense of "Hunter".

Apollo's chief <a href="epithet">epithet</a> was Phoebus ( ; , "Phoibos" ), literally "bright". It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in <a href="Latin%20literature">Latin literature</a>.



Apollo's birthplace was <a href="Cynthus">Mount Cynthus</a> on the island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a>.


<a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> and <a href="Actium">Actium</a> were his primary places of worship.







Apollo was worshipped throughout the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. In the traditionally <a href="Celtic%20nations">Celtic</a> lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with <a href="List%20of%20Celtic%20gods">Celtic gods</a> of similar character.

The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> and <a href="Delos">Delos</a>, date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of <a href="Pytho">Pytho</a>. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In <a href="archaic%20period%20in%20Greece">archaic Greece</a> he was the <a href="prophet">prophet</a>, the oracular god who in older times was connected with "healing". In <a href="classical%20period%20in%20Greece">classical Greece</a> he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil. <a href="Walter%20Burkert">Walter Burkert</a> discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed "a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component."

From his eastern origin Apollo brought the art of inspection of "symbols and <a href="omen">omina</a>" (σημεία και τέρατα : "semeia kai terata"), and of the observation of the <a href="omen">omen</a>s of the days. The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. The <a href="ritual">ritual</a>ism belonged to Apollo from the beginning. The Greeks created the <a href="Legalism%20%28Western%20philosophy%29">legalism</a>, the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony. Apollo became the god of shining youth, ideal beauty, fine arts, philosophy, moderation, spiritual-life, the protector of music, divine law and perceptible order. The improvement of the old <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>n god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the <a href="Greek%20people">Greek people</a>.

The function of Apollo as a "healer" is connected with <a href="Paean%20%28god%29">Paean</a> (), the physician of the Gods in the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", who seems to come from a more primitive religion. Paeοn is probably connected with the <a href="Mycenean%20Greece">Mycenean</a> "pa-ja-wo-ne" (Linear B: ), but this is not certain. He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease. Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song "paean" (). The magicians were also called "seer-doctors" (), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.

In the "Iliad", Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the <a href="Vedic">Vedic</a> god of disease <a href="Rudra">Rudra</a>. He sends a plague () to the <a href="Achaeans%20%28Homer%29">Achaeans</a>. The god who sends a disease can also prevent it; therefore, when it stops, they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a <a href="hecatomb">hecatomb</a> to ward off evil. When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the "Paean".

Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are "paion" (, literally "healer" or "helper") "epikourios" (, "help"), "oulios" (, "healed wound", also a "scar" ) and "loimios" (, "plague"). In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called "apotropaios" (, "divert", "deter", "avert") and "alexikakos" (from <a href="verb">v.</a> + <a href="noun">n.</a> , "defend from evil"). In later writers, the word, usually spelled "Paean", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of <a href="healing">healing</a>.

Homer illustrated Paeon the god, and the song both of <a href="apotropaic">apotropaic</a> thanksgiving or triumph.
Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, to Apollo <a href="Helios">Helios</a>, to Apollo's son <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a> the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the <a href="Python%20%28mythology%29">Python</a> led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

The connection with the Dorians and their initiation festival "<a href="apellai">apellai</a>" is reinforced by the month "Apellaios" in northwest Greek calendars. The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo (<a href="Dorians">Doric</a>: ). "Apellaios" is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the "megistos kouros" (the great Kouros). However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20language">Ancient Macedonian</a> word "pella" (<a href="Pella">Pella</a>), "stone". Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi (<a href="Omphalos">Omphalos</a>).

The "<a href="Homeric%20hymn">Homeric hymn</a>" represents Apollo as a Northern intruder. His arrival must have occurred during the "<a href="Greek%20Dark%20Ages">Dark Ages</a>" that followed the destruction of the <a href="Mycenaean%20civilization">Mycenaean civilization</a>, and his conflict with <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaia</a> (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent <a href="Python%20%28mythology%29">Python</a>.

The earth deity had power over the ghostly world, and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle. The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated. A female dragon named <a href="Delphyne">Delphyne</a> (, "womb"), and a male serpent <a href="Typhon">Typhon</a> (, "to smoke"), the adversary of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> in the <a href="Titanomachy">Titanomachy</a>, who the narrators confused with <a href="Python%20%28mythology%29">Python</a>. Python was the good <a href="Daemon%20%28classical%20mythology%29">daemon</a> (ἀγαθὸς δαίμων) of the temple as it appears in <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> religion, but she was represented as a dragon, as often happens in Northern European folklore as well as in the East.

Apollo and his sister <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> can bring death with their arrows. The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in <a href="Germanic%20mythology">Germanic</a> and <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> Artemis was the leader (, "hegemon") of the <a href="nymphs">nymphs</a>, who had similar functions with the <a href="Norse%20mythology">Nordic</a> <a href="Elf">Elves</a>. The "elf-shot" originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting stone <a href="arrow%20%28weapon%29">arrow</a>-heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.

The <a href="Vedic">Vedic</a> Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called "The Archer", and the bow is also an attribute of <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>. Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them, and his alternative Shiba is a healer physician god. However the <a href="Indo-European%20language">Indo-European</a> component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.

It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> age. In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called <a href="labrys">Labryaden</a>, "the double-axe men", which indicates <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> origin. The double-axe, <a href="labrys">labrys</a>, was the holy symbol of the <a href="Crete">Cretan</a> <a href="labyrinth">labyrinth</a>. The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. "Apollo Delphinios" or "Delphidios" was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands. Apollo's sister <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with <a href="Britomartis">Britomartis</a> (<a href="Diktynna">Diktynna</a>), the <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> "Mistress of the animals". In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the "Mister of the animals", a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute. His original name is unknown, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo, who stood by the virgin "Mistress of the Animals", becoming her brother.

The old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood, and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple. This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition. In that regard, the mythical seeress <a href="Sibyl">Sibyl</a> of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>n origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself. However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.

<a href="Plato">Plato</a> describes the priestesses of Delphi and <a href="Dodona">Dodona</a> as frenzied women, obsessed by "<a href="mania">mania</a>" (, "frenzy"), a Greek word he connected with "mantis" (, "prophet"). Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> as <a href="Mari%2C%20Syria">Mari</a> in the second millennium BC. Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC, there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages. It is more probable that this art was introduced later from <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.

A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship. The name of Apollo's mother <a href="Leto">Leto</a> has <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>n origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, which is the origin of <a href="Sibyl">Sibyl</a>, and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old <a href="Assyria">Assyro</a>-<a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>ian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a>. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain "purification".

A similar story is mentioned by <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>. He writes that the <a href="Creta">Creta</a>n <a href="prophet">seer</a> <a href="Epimenides">Epimenides</a> purified <a href="Athens">Athens</a> after the pollution brought by the <a href="Alcmeonidae">Alcmeonidae</a>, and that the seer's expertise in <a href="sacrifice">sacrifice</a>s and reform of funeral practices were of great help to <a href="Solon">Solon</a> in his reform of the Athenian state. The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the <a href="Shamanism%23Asia">shamanic religions of Asia</a>, and proves, together with the <a href="Homeric">Homeric</a> hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to historical times. It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>.

<a href="Homer">Homer</a> pictures Apollo on the side of the <a href="Troy">Trojans</a>, fighting against the <a href="Achaeans%20%28Homer%29">Achaeans</a>, during the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to "Appaliunas", a tutelary god of <a href="Wilusa">Wilusa</a> (<a href="Troy">Troy</a>) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete. The stones found in front of the gates of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>ic Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of "Artimus" (<a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>) and "Qλdãns", whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving <a href="Lydian%20language">Lydian</a> texts"." However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of "Qλdãns" with Apollo.

The Greeks gave to him the name "<a href="agyieus">agyieus</a>" as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column. However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the <a href="full%20moon">full moon</a>, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day ("sibutu") indicates a <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>n origin.

The <a href="Late%20Bronze%20Age">Late Bronze Age</a> (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) <a href="Hittites">Hittite</a> and <a href="Hurrian">Hurrian</a> "Aplu" was a god of <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>, invoked during plague years. Here we have an <a href="apotrope">apotropaic</a> situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning "the son of", was a title given to the god <a href="Nergal">Nergal</a>, who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun <a href="Shamash">Shamash</a>. Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god () who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods. In "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", his priest prays to "Apollo Smintheus", the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats. All these functions, including the function of the healer-god <a href="Paean%20%28god%29">Paean</a>, who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.

Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: <a href="Delos">Delos</a> and <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>. In cult practice, <a href="Delos">Delian Apollo</a> and <a href="Pythian%20Apollo">Pythian Apollo</a> (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality. Apollo's <a href="Cult%20%28religion%29">cult</a> was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the <a href="Archaic%20Greece">archaic period</a>, and the frequency of <a href="theophoric%20names">theophoric names</a> such as "Apollodorus" or "Apollonios" and cities named "Apollonia" testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at <a href="Didyma">Didyma</a> and <a href="Clarus">Clarus</a> pronounced the so-called "theological oracles", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an <a href="Monism%23Monism%2C%20pantheism%2C%20and%20panentheism">all-encompassing, highest deity</a>. "In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. <a href="Julian%20the%20Apostate">Julian the Apostate</a> (359–361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed."

Apollo had a famous <a href="oracle">oracle</a> in Delphi, and other notable ones in <a href="Clarus">Clarus</a> and <a href="Branchidae">Branchidae</a>. His oracular shrine in <a href="Abae">Abae</a> in <a href="Phocis">Phocis</a>, where he bore the <a href="toponym">toponym</a>ic epithet "<a href="Abaeus">Abaeus</a>" (, "Apollon Abaios"), was important enough to be consulted by <a href="Croesus">Croesus</a>.
His oracular shrines include:

Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.

Many temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectanglular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered <a href="divine">divine</a>, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of <a href="Doric%20order">Doric order</a>. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection. From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>, who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.
The <a href="Doric%20order">Doric order</a> dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn’t be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic order</a>, but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian order</a> gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.

The most important temples are:






When Zeus' wife <a href="Hera">Hera</a> discovered that <a href="Leto">Leto</a> was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on "<a href="Solid%20Earth">terra firma</a>". In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a>, which was neither mainland nor a real island. She gave birth there and was accepted by the people, offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. This island later became sacred to Apollo.

It is also stated that Hera kidnapped <a href="Eileithyia">Eileithyia</a>, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards or 8.2 meters long.

Soon after he was born, Apollo was washed clean by the goddesses and was covered in white garment, with golden bands fastened around him. Since Leto was unable to feed the new born Apollo, <a href="Themis">Themis</a>, the goddess of divine law, fed him the nectar and <a href="ambrosia">ambrosia</a>. Upon tasting the divine food, Apollo broke free of the bands fastened to him and declared that he would be the master of <a href="lyre">lyre</a> and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind.

Mythographers agree that <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born on the island of <a href="Ortygia">Ortygia</a> and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the seventh day (, "hebdomagenes") of the month <a href="Attic%20calendar%23Festival%20calendar">Thargelion</a> —according to Delian tradition—or of the month <a href="Hellenic%20calendars%23Delphic">Bysios</a>—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.

Four days after his birth, Apollo killed the <a href="chthonic">chthonic</a> dragon <a href="Python%20%28mythology%29">Python</a>, which lived in <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> beside the <a href="Castalian%20Spring">Castalian Spring</a>, and was a terror to the people. Hera had sent the serpent to hunt the pregnant Leto to her death across the world. To avenge the trouble given to his mother, Apollo asked <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> for a bow and arrows. After receiving them, Apollo cornered Python in the sacred cave at Delphi. He killed Python with his arrows, but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of <a href="Gaia">Gaia</a>. He exiled himself in order to get purified. Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed people from the sin of murder and made men aware of their own guilt and purified them of it. Soon after, he needed to recruit people to his land. So, when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin. The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi. There Apollo revealed himself as a god and initiated them to his service and instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts.

Hera once again sent another giant, <a href="Tityos">Tityos</a> to rape Leto. This time Apollo was aided by his sister Artemis in protecting their mother. Artemis attacked with her arrows and Apollo with his golden sword. After the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to <a href="Tartarus">Tartarus</a>. There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of , where a pair of <a href="vulture">vulture</a>s feasted daily on his liver.

Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a> in retribution for <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>'s insult to <a href="Chryses">Chryses</a>, a priest of Apollo whose daughter <a href="Chryseis">Chryseis</a> had been captured. He demanded her return, and the Achaeans complied, indirectly causing the "<a href="Achilles%20and%20Patroclus%23In%20the%20Iliad">anger of Achilles</a>", which is the theme of the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>".
In the Iliad, when <a href="Diomedes">Diomedes</a> injured <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, Apollo rescued him. First, <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well. Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Apollo, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in <a href="Troy">Troy</a>.
The Trojan hero <a href="Hector">Hector</a> was favored by Apollo, who, according to some, was the god's own son by <a href="Hecuba">Hecuba</a>. Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up the arms. Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him from Achilles. After Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse.

After the death of <a href="Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>, a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep (<a href="Hypnos">Hypnos</a>) and Death (<a href="Thanatos">Thanatos</a>).
Apollo aided <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a> in the killing of Achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>' heel. One of Apollo's motives was to was to avenge the murder of <a href="Troilus">Troilus</a>, the his son by <a href="Hecuba">Hecuba</a>, on the very <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20religion%23Practices">altar</a> of his temple. Apollo also sought vengeance for the death <a href="Tenes">Tenes</a>, another son of his, whom Achilles killed in spite of Thetis warning that Apollo would personally kill Achilles for this act.
Apollo helped many Trojan warriors, including <a href="Agenor">Agenor</a>, <a href="Polydamas%20%28mythology%29">Polydamas</a>, <a href="Glaucus">Glaucus</a> in the battlefield.

When Zeus struck down Apollo's son <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a> with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead (transgressing <a href="Themis">Themis</a> (divine law) by stealing <a href="Hades">Hades</a>'s subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the <a href="Cyclops">Cyclopes</a>, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus. Apollo would have been banished to <a href="Tartarus">Tartarus</a> forever for this, but was instead sentenced to one year of <a href="Penal%20labour">hard labor</a>, due to the intercession of his mother, <a href="Leto">Leto</a>. During this time he served as <a href="shepherd">shepherd</a> for <a href="Admetus">King Admetus</a> of <a href="Pherae">Pherae</a> in <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus. According to some, Apollo shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay.

Apollo helped Admetus win <a href="Alcestis">Alcestis</a>, the daughter of <a href="Pelias">King Pelias</a> and later convinced the <a href="Moirai">Fates</a> to let Admetus live past his time, if another took his place. But when it came time for Admetus to die, his parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. Instead, Alcestis took his place, but <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> managed to fight <a href="Thanatos">Thanatos</a>, the god of death, and returned her to the world of the living, to her husband.

The fate of <a href="Niobe">Niobe</a> was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb. Niobe was the queen of <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a> and wife of <a href="Amphion">Amphion</a>. She displayed <a href="hubris">hubris</a> when she boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children (<a href="Niobids">Niobids</a>), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.

A devastated Niobe fled to <a href="Spil%20Mount">Mount Sipylos</a> in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river <a href="Achelous">Achelous</a>. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

As a child, Apollo built an altar made of goat horns which was considered as one of the wonders of the world. 
In the first <a href="Olympics">Olympics</a>, Apollo defeated <a href="Ares">Ares</a> and became the victor in wrestling. He outran <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> in the race and won first place.
Apollo killed the <a href="Aloadae">Aloadae</a> when they attempted to storm <a href="Mount%20Olympus%20%28Mountain%29">Mt. Olympus</a>.
Apollo aided Zeus in killing <a href="Porphyrion">Porphyrion</a>, the king of giants.
Apollo defeated and killed <a href="Phorbas">Phorbas</a>, a robber, who had seized the roads to <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> and was harassing the pilgrims.
Apollo rescued <a href="Hemithea%20%28mythology%29">Hemithea</a> and <a href="Parthenos%20%28sister%20of%20Hemithea%29">Parthenos</a>, sisters of <a href="Rhoeo">Rhoeo</a>, and turned them into goddesses.
Apollo made the island <a href="Anafi">Anafi</a> appear to the Argonaut to shelter them from a bad storm, by using his bow to shed light upon it.
Apollo fostered <a href="Chiron">Chiron</a>, the wise <a href="centaur">centaur</a> and instructed him in the art of medicine, prophecy and archery.
Apollo equipped his son <a href="Aristaeus">Aristaeus</a> for the Indian war (waged by <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> against Indians) by providing him with bow, arrows and a shield. He later on rescued Aristaeus from drowning in a river during the war.

Apollo requested Zeus to spare <a href="Periphas">Periphas</a>, a noble king, who was honoured to the same extent as Zeus, due to which the latter wished to destroy him. At the request of Apollo, however, Zeus metamorphosed him into an eagle.

Apollo saved a shepherd (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by the means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.

Apollo guided Aphrodite, who was grief-stricken with Adonis' death, to his sanctuary and helped her free herself from the heartbreak.
Apollo divides months into summer and winter. He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the <a href="Hyperborea">Hyperborea</a>ns during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, and no prophecies were given during winters.
Apollo turned <a href="Cephissus%20%28mythology%29">Cephissus</a> into a <a href="sea%20monster">sea monster</a>.
Another contender for the birthplace of Apollo is the Cretan islands of <a href="Paximadia%20%28islands%29">Paximadia</a>.

<a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> was born on <a href="Mount%20Kyllini">Mount Cyllene</a> in Arcadia. The story is told in the <a href="Homeric%20Hymn">Homeric Hymn</a> to <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>. His mother, <a href="Maia%20%28mythology%29">Maia</a>, had been secretly impregnated by <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>. Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep.

Hermes ran to <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, where Apollo was grazing his cattle. The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near <a href="Pylos">Pylos</a>, covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a> and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first <a href="lyre">lyre</a>.

Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo's claim. Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.

Once <a href="Pan%20%28mythology%29">Pan</a> had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge Apollo, the god of music. The mountain-god <a href="Tmolus">Tmolus</a> was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, <a href="Midas">Midas</a>, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone were pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a <a href="donkey">donkey</a>.

<a href="Marsyas">Marsyas</a> was a <a href="satyr">satyr</a> who was punished by Apollo for his <a href="hubris">hubris</a>. He had found an <a href="aulos">aulos</a> on the ground, tossed away after being invented by <a href="Athena">Athena</a> because it made her cheeks puffy. When he played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the <a href="Muse">Muse</a>s. The contestants agreed to the rule that the victor can do anything with the loser.

After they each performed, both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time. As Apollo played the <a href="lyre">lyre</a>, this was easy to do. Marsyas could not do this, as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time. Apollo was declared the winner because of this. 
According to some, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.
Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the <a href="flute">flute</a>), and so Apollo hung him from a tree to flay him alive. 

Apollo <a href="flaying">flayed</a> Marsyas alive in a cave near <a href="Celaenae">Celaenae</a> in <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a> for his <a href="hubris">hubris</a> to challenge a god. He then nailed Marsyas' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree. Marsyas' blood turned into the river <a href="Marsyas%20%28river%29">Marsyas</a>.
Apollo, as an act of repent and purification for killing Marsyas, tore the strings of his lyre and stayed away from music for a long time.

Apollo also had a <a href="lyre">lyre</a>-playing contest with <a href="Cinyras">Cinyras</a>, his son, who committed suicide when he lost.

Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology. Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

<a href="Daphne">Daphne</a> was a <a href="nymph">nymph</a>, daughter of the <a href="Sea%20and%20river%20deity">river god</a> <a href="Peneus">Peneus</a>, who had scorned Apollo. The myth explains the connection of Apollo with δάφνη ("daphnē"), the <a href="Bay%20Laurel">laurel</a> whose leaves his priestess employed at <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>. In <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", Phoebus Apollo chaffs <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a> for toying with a weapon more suited to a man, whereupon Cupid wounds him with a golden dart; simultaneously, however, Cupid shoots a leaden arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prays to her father Peneus for help and he changes her into the laurel tree, sacred to Apollo.

Artemis Daphnaia, who had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi in Antiquity, on the slopes of Mount Cnacadion near the Spartan frontier, had her own sacred laurel trees. At <a href="Eretria">Eretria</a> the identity of an excavated 7th- and 6th-century temple to "Apollo Daphnephoros", "Apollo, laurel-bearer", or "carrying off Daphne", a "place where the citizens are to take the oath", is identified in inscriptions.
Apollo is said to have been the lover of all nine <a href="Muses">Muses</a>, and not being able to choose one of them, decided to remain unwed.. He fathered the <a href="Corybantes">Corybantes</a> by the Muse <a href="Thalia%20%28Muse%29">Thalia</a>, <a href="Orpheus">Orpheus</a> by <a href="Calliope">Calliope</a>, <a href="Linus%20%28Thracian%29">Linus of Thrace</a> by Calliope or <a href="Urania">Urania</a> and <a href="Hymenaios">Hymenaios</a>(Hymen) by either <a href="Terpsichore">Terpsichore</a> or <a href="Clio">Clio</a> or Calliope.
<a href="Cyrene%20%28mythology%29">Cyrene</a>, was a Thessalian princess whom Apollo loved. In her honor, he built the city Cyrene and made her it's ruler. She was later granted longevity by Apollo who turned her into a nymph. The couple had two sons, <a href="Aristaeus">Aristaeus</a>, and <a href="Idmon">Idmon</a>.

<a href="Evadne">Evadne</a> was princess or nymph of Arcadia and a lover of Apollo. She bore him a son, <a href="Iamos">Iamos</a>. During the time of the childbirth, Apollo sent <a href="Eileithyia">Eileithyia</a>, the goddess of childbirth to assist her.

<a href="Rhoeo">Rhoeo</a>, a princess of the island of Naxos was loved by Apollo. Out of affection for her, Apollo turned her sisters into goddesses. On the island Delos she bore Apollo a son named <a href="Anius">Anius</a>. She entrusted the child to Apollo, who raised and educated the child on his own. 

Hyrie or Thyrie was the mother of <a href="Cycnus%20%28son%20of%20Apollo%29">Cycnus</a>. Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves.

<a href="Hecuba">Hecuba</a> was the wife of King <a href="Priam">Priam</a> of <a href="Troy">Troy</a>, and Apollo had a son with her named <a href="Troilus">Troilus</a>. An <a href="oracle">oracle</a> prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by <a href="Achilleus">Achilleus</a>, and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles.

<a href="Marpessa">Marpessa</a> was kidnapped by <a href="Idas">Idas</a> but was loved by Apollo as well. <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

<a href="Bolina">Bolina</a> was admired by Apollo but she refused his advances and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph and let her go. 

<a href="Castalia">Castalia</a> was a <a href="nymph">nymph</a> whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the <a href="castalian%20Spring">spring</a> at Delphi, at the base of <a href="Mt.%20Parnassos">Mt. Parnassos</a>, which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses. In the last <a href="oracle">oracle</a> is mentioned that the "water which could speak", has been lost for ever.

<a href="Cassandra">Cassandra</a>, was daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilus' half-sister. Apollo fell in love with Cassandra and she promised to return it on a condition that Apollo gift to her the prophetic powers. Apollo granted her wish but she rejected him afterwards. Enraged, Apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future, with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her.

<a href="Coronis%20%28Greek%20mythology%29">Coronis</a>, was daughter of <a href="Phlegyas">Phlegyas</a>, King of the <a href="Lapiths">Lapiths</a>. While pregnant with <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a>, Coronis fell in love with <a href="Ischys">Ischys</a>, son of <a href="Elatus">Elatus</a> and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis' belly and gave it to the <a href="centaur">centaur</a> <a href="Chiron">Chiron</a> to raise.

In <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>' play "<a href="Ion%20%28play%29">Ion</a>", Apollo fathered <a href="Ion%20%28mythology%29">Ion</a> by <a href="Creusa%20%28daughter%20of%20Erechtheus%29">Creusa</a>, wife of <a href="Xuthus">Xuthus</a>. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> to save the child and bring him to the oracle at <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>, where he was raised by a priestess.

<a href="Hyacinth%20%28mythology%29">Hyacinth</a> or Hyacinthus was one of Apollo's male lovers. He was a <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair was practicing throwing the <a href="Discus%20throw">discus</a> when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous <a href="Zephyrus">Zephyrus</a> and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief: out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a <a href="hyacinth%20%28plant%29">flower</a> named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection , meaning "alas".He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival <a href="Hyacinthia">Hyacinthia</a> was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.
Another male lover was <a href="Cyparissus">Cyparissus</a>, a descendant of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a <a href="Pilum">javelin</a> as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the <a href="Cupressaceae">Cypress</a> named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

Other male lovers of Apollo include:


In <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>' "<a href="Oresteia">Oresteia</a>" trilogy, <a href="Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</a> kills her husband, King <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> because he had sacrificed their daughter <a href="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a> to proceed forward with the Trojan war, and <a href="Cassandra">Cassandra</a>, a prophetess of Apollo. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, <a href="Orestes">Orestes</a>, is to kill Clytemnestra and <a href="Aegisthus">Aegisthus</a>, her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the <a href="Erinyes">Erinyes</a> or Furies (female personifications of <a href="revenge">vengeance</a>).

Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the <a href="matricide">matricide</a> was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's <a href="Supplication">supplicant</a>. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. As a quintessentially <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20figures">Greek god</a>, Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus. There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the <a href="Roman%20Kingdom">kings of Rome</a> during the reign of <a href="Tarquinius%20Superbus">Tarquinius Superbus</a>.

On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's <a href="Temple%20of%20Apollo%20Sosianus">first temple</a> at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the "Apollinare". During the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a> in 212 BCE, the "<a href="Ludi%20Apollinares">Ludi Apollinares</a>" ("Apollonian Games") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius. In the time of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.

After the <a href="battle%20of%20Actium">battle of Actium</a>, which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted <a href="quinquennial">quinquennial</a> games in his honour. He also erected <a href="Temple%20of%20Apollo%20%28Palatine%29">a new temple</a> to the god on the <a href="Palatine%20Hill">Palatine hill</a>. Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a> formed the culmination of the <a href="Secular%20Games">Secular Games</a>, held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.

The chief Apollonian festival was the <a href="Pythian%20Games">Pythian Games</a> held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great <a href="Panhellenic%20Games">Panhellenic Games</a>. Also of major importance was the <a href="Delia%20%28festival%29">Delia</a> held every four years on Delos.
Athenian annual festivals included the <a href="Boedromia">Boedromia</a>, <a href="Metageitnia">Metageitnia</a>, <a href="Pyanepsia">Pyanepsia</a>, and <a href="Thargelia">Thargelia</a>.
Spartan annual festivals were the <a href="Carneia">Carneia</a> and the <a href="Hyacinthia">Hyacinthia</a>.
<a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a> every nine years held the <a href="Daphnephoria">Daphnephoria</a>.

Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and <a href="arrow">arrow</a>. Other attributes of his included the <a href="kithara">kithara</a> (an advanced version of the common <a href="lyre">lyre</a>), the <a href="plectrum">plectrum</a> and the sword. Another common emblem was the <a href="sacrificial%20tripod">sacrificial tripod</a>, representing his prophetic powers. The <a href="Pythian%20Games">Pythian Games</a> were held in Apollo's honor every four years at <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>. The <a href="bay%20laurel">bay laurel</a> plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the <a href="laurel%20wreath">crown of victory</a> at these games.

The <a href="palm%20tree">palm tree</a> was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in <a href="Delos">Delos</a>. Animals sacred to Apollo included <a href="wolf">wolves</a>, dolphins, <a href="roe%20deer">roe deer</a>, <a href="swan">swan</a>s, <a href="cicada">cicada</a>s (symbolizing music and song), <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, <a href="raven">raven</a>s, <a href="Corvus%20%28genus%29">crow</a>s, snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and <a href="griffin">griffin</a>s, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.
As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped <a href="Crete">Cretan</a> or <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>n colonists found the city of <a href="Troy">Troy</a>. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: <a href="Hittites">Hittite</a> <a href="Cuneiform%20script">cuneiform</a> texts mention a Minor Asian god called "Appaliunas" or "Apalunas" in connection with the city of <a href="Wilusa">Wilusa</a> attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek <a href="Troy">Ilion</a> by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of "Lykegenes" can simply be read as "born in Lycia", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a>).

In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives <a href="Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian">Apollonian and Dionysian</a>. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for <a href="Hyperborea">Hyperborea</a>, he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the <a href="Borghese%20Vase">Borghese Vase</a>.

Apollo is often associated with the <a href="Golden%20mean%20%28philosophy%29">Golden Mean</a>. This is the Greek <a href="Ideal%20%28ethics%29">ideal</a> of <a href="moderation">moderation</a> and a <a href="virtue">virtue</a> that opposes <a href="gluttony">gluttony</a>.

Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. The earliest Greek word for a statue is "delight" (, "agalma"), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.

The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.

The evolution of the Greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal <a href="Kouros">Kouros</a> type in <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20Greece">early archaic period</a>, to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20Greece">late archaic period</a>. In <a href="classical%20Greece">classical Greece</a> the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms, but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole, a method created by <a href="Polykleitos">Polykleitos</a>. Finally <a href="Praxiteles">Praxiteles</a> seems to be released from any art and religious conformities, and his masterpieces are a mixture of <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">naturalism</a> with stylization.

The evolution of the Greek art seems to go parallel with the Greek philosophical conceptions, which changed from the natural-philosophy of <a href="Thales">Thales</a> to the <a href="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> theory of <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>. Thales searched for a simple material-form directly perceptible by the senses, behind the appearances of things, and his theory is also related to the older <a href="animism">animism</a>. This was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life, through unnaturally simplified forms.

Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation. The forms on earth, are imperfect imitations (, "eikones", "images") of the celestial world of numbers. His ideas had a great influence on post-Archaic art. The Greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation, that would lead to the esthetic perfection. (<a href="Aesthetic%20canon">canon</a>).

In classical Greece, <a href="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a> asserted that a divine reason (mind) gave order to the seeds of the universe, and <a href="Plato">Plato</a> extended the Greek belief of "ideal forms" to his metaphysical theory of "forms" ("ideai", "ideas"). The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words "oida" (, "(I) know") and "eidos" (, "species"), a thing seen, have the same root as the word "idea" (), a thing ἰδείν to see. indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses. The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization. The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.

<a href="Kouros">Kouros</a> ("male youth") is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the <a href="archaic%20period%20in%20Greece">archaic period in Greece</a>. This type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of "Apollo". The first statues are certainly still and formal. The formality of their stance seems to be related with the <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian precedent, but it was accepted for a good reason. The sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is, and embodied the archaic smile of good manners, the firm and springy step, the balance of the body, dignity, and youthful happiness. When they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men, it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods. The adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time, is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions, and also due to the general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in "ideal forms" that can be imagined and represented. These forms expressed immortality. Apollo was the immortal god of "ideal balance and order". His shrine in <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>, that he shared in winter with Dionysius had the inscriptions: (gnōthi seautón="know thyself") and ("mēdén ágan", "nothing in excess"), and (eggýa pára d'atē, "make a pledge and mischief is nigh").
In the first large-scale depictions during the early archaic period (640–580 BC), the artists tried to draw one's attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses, but as being full of life. The Greeks maintained, until late in their civilization, an almost <a href="animism">animistic</a> idea that the statues are in some sense alive. This embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself. A fine example is the statue of the "<a href="Sacred%20Gate">Sacred Gate</a> Kouros" which was found at the cemetery of <a href="Dipylon">Dipylon</a> in Athens (<a href="Dipylon%20Kouros">Dipylon Kouros</a>). The statue is the "thing in itself", and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. According to the Greek tradition the <a href="Dipylon">Dipylon master</a> was named <a href="Daedalus">Daedalus</a>, and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. It is considered that he created also the "New York kouros", which is the oldest fully preserved statue of "Kouros" type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.
The animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the <a href="Homeric">Homeric</a> poems and in Greek myths, in stories of the god <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> (<a href="Phaistos">Phaistos</a>) and the mythic <a href="Daedalus">Daedalus</a> (the builder of the <a href="labyrinth">labyrinth</a>) that made images which moved of their own accord. This kind of art goes back to the <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment. These free-standing statues were usually marble, but also the form rendered in limestone, bronze, ivory and terracotta.

The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo, may be two figures from the <a href="Ionians">Ionic</a> sanctuary on the island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a>. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of "Apollo Ptoios", <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> alone. The last stage in the development of the "Kouros type" is the late archaic period (520–485 BC), in which the Greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole. Ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze <a href="Piraeus%20Apollo">Piraeus Apollo</a>. It was found in <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, the harbour of Athens. The statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand. It probably comes from north-eastern <a href="Peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</a>. The emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-Archaic art. The statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler and heavier style, restricts <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>n influence in Athens. Finally, this is the germ from which the art of <a href="Polykleitos">Polykleitos</a> was to grow two or three generations later.

At the beginning of the <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical period</a>, it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else, consisted of symmetry and proportions. The artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment (<a href="Myron">Myron</a>), which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> element. Anatomy and geometry are fused in one, and each does something to the other. The Greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions, just as they sought some reality behind appearances. <a href="Polykleitos">Polykleitos</a> in his "Canon" wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>.
The famous "Apollo of Mantua" and its variants are early forms of the <a href="Apollo%20Citharoedus">Apollo Citharoedus</a> statue type, in which the god holds the <a href="cithara">cithara</a> in his left arm. The type is represented by <a href="neo-Attic">neo-Attic</a> Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of <a href="Polykleitos">Polykleitos</a> but more archaic. The Apollo held the "cythara" against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.

Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> period, and in the beliefs of the first <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self. Things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.

In the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.

The <a href="Siphnian%20Treasury">Siphnian Treasury</a> in <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> was one of the first Greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling. The pediment shows the story of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> stealing Apollo's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration. Their two figures hold the centre. In the pediment of the temple of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> in <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a>, the single figure of Apollo is dominating the scene.

These representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake. They care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole. While each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs. In these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and from a busy battlefield. The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.

Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a <a href="kithara">kithara</a> (as <a href="Apollo%20Citharoedus">Apollo Citharoedus</a>) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the <a href="Apollo%20Lykeios">Apollo Lykeios</a> and <a href="Apollo%20Sauroctonos">Apollo Sauroctonos</a> types). The <a href="Apollo%20Belvedere">Apollo Belvedere</a> is a <a href="marble">marble</a> sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of <a href="Classical%20Antiquity">Classical Antiquity</a> for Europeans, from the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> through the 19th century. The marble is a <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic</a> or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor <a href="Leochares">Leochares</a>, made between 350 and 325 BCE.

The life-size so-called "<a href="Adonis">Adonis</a>" found in 1780 on the site of a "<a href="Roman%20villa">villa suburbana</a>" near the <a href="Via%20Labicana">Via Labicana</a> in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from <a href="El%20Djem">El Djem</a>, Roman "Thysdrus", he is identifiable as <a href="Helios">Apollo Helios</a> by his effulgent <a href="Halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29">halo</a>, though now even a god's divine <a href="nudity">nakedness</a> is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later <a href="Roman%20Empire">Empire</a>.

Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from <a href="Hadrumentum">Hadrumentum</a>, is in the museum at <a href="Sousse">Sousse</a>. The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling <a href="Hairstyle">hair cut</a> in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

Apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature. <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a> composed a "Hymn of Apollo" (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>'s "<a href="Apollon%20musag%C3%A8te">Apollon musagète</a>" (1927–1928). In 1978, the Canadian band <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a> released <a href="Hemispheres%20%28Rush%20album%29">an album</a> with songs .

In discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the <a href="Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian">Apollonian and Dionysian</a> impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable. <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>'s <a href="Apollo%20archetype">Apollo archetype</a> represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.

<a href="Charles%20Handy">Charles Handy</a>, in "Gods of Management" (1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of <a href="organizational%20culture">organisational culture</a>. Apollo represents a 'role' culture where order, reason, and <a href="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> prevail.

In spaceflight, the <a href="NASA">NASA</a> program for landing astronauts on the Moon was named <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo</a>.
