[Q6199: Anarchism]

Anarchism is a [Q179805: political%20philosophy] that advocates [Q417633: Self-governance] societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as [Q1708603: Stateless%20society], although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-[Q188619: Hierarchy] or [0: Free%20association%20%28communism%20and%20anarchism%29]. Anarchism holds the [Q7275: State%20%28polity%29] to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.
While [Q646407: Anti-statism] is central, anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations. Anarchism is usually considered a [Q1129409: Far-left%20politics] ideology and much of [Q4751666: anarchist%20economics] and [Q2738779: Anarchist%20law] reflects [Q1852084: Libertarian%20socialism] of [Q188670: Anarcho-communism], [Q223178: Collectivist%20anarchism], [Q188993: Anarcho-syndicalism], [Q844212: Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29], or [Q650953: participatory%20economics].
Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive. [Q1278791: Anarchist%20schools%20of%20thought] can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [Q171995: individualism] to complete [Q237789: collectivism]. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of [Q370919: Social%20anarchism] and [Q7076: individualist%20anarchism] or similar dual classifications.
The word "[0: wikt%3Aanarchism]" is composed from the word "[Q31895: anarchy]" and the suffix [Q158646: -ism], themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. "anarchy" (from , "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the [Q41352: privative] prefix [0: privative%20alpha]- ("an-", i.e. "without") and , "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf. "[Q193379: archon]" or , "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix or ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal [Q179230: infinitive] suffix , "-izein"). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the [Q6534: French%20Revolution] labelled opponents as anarchists (as [Q44197: Maximilien%20Robespierre] did the [Q1474268: H%C3%A9bertists]) although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as [Q188569: William%20Godwin] and [Q215808: Wilhelm%20Weitling], but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.
The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was [Q5749: Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon], marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, the term "[Q178598: libertarianism]" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only, referring to free market anarchism as [Q18206851: libertarian%20anarchism].
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC among the works of [Q9598: Taoism] philosopher [Q9333: Laozi] and in later centuries by [Q47739: Zhuang%20Zhou] and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote: "A petty thief is put in jail. A great [Old French: wikt%3Abrigand] becomes a ruler of a Nation". [0: Diogenes%20of%20Sinope] and the [Q485459: Cynicism%20%28philosophy%29] as well as their contemporary [Q171303: Zeno%20of%20Citium], the founder of [Q48235: Stoicism], also introduced similar topics. [Q302: Jesus] is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the [Q329659: Christian%20anarchism] tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote: "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and [...] the first anarchist society was that of the [0: Apostle%20%28Christian%29]". In early [Q642379: History%20of%20Islam], some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the [Q3769089: Second%20Fitna] over the [Q131401: Caliphate], where the [0: Kharijites] insisted that the [Q2989480: imamate] is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.
The French [Q846933: Renaissance%20humanism] political philosopher [Q290227: %C3%89tienne%20de%20La%20Bo%C3%A9tie] wrote in his most famous work the "[Q3030191: Discourse%20on%20Voluntary%20Servitude]" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. The radical [0: Protestant%20Christianity] [Q964050: Gerrard%20Winstanley] and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642 during the [Q80330: English%20Civil%20War] as a [Q545779: Pejorative], used by [Q2284765: Cavalier] against their [Q1130553: Roundhead] opponents. By the time of the [Q6534: French%20Revolution], some such as the [Q1343705: Enrag%C3%A9s] began to use the term positively in opposition to [Q1679542: Jacobin%20%28politics%29] centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as [Q169429: oxymoron]ic. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.
Modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the [Q12539: Age%20of%20Enlightenment], particularly [Q6527: Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, [Q188569: William%20Godwin] developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought. According to [Q5752: Peter%20Kropotkin], Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work" while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [Q165792: Edmund%20Burke].
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as [Q778779: philosophical%20anarchism]. He argued in "[0: Political%20Justice]" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.
His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people's "mental enslavement" the foundations of law, [0: property%20rights] and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.
The French [Q5749: Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon] is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work "[0: What%20is%20Property%3F]", published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of [Q631781: spontaneous%20order] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". In "What is Property?", Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "[0: Property%20is%20theft]". In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called "possession", or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. However, Proudhon later added that "Property is Liberty" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion and certain [0: capitalist] practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.
The [Q188670: Anarcho-communism] [Q2423099: Joseph%20D%C3%A9jacque] was the first person to describe himself as "[Q178598: Libertarianism]". Unlike Proudhon, he argued that "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature". In 1844, the [0: post-Hegelian] philosopher [Q76725: Max%20Stirner] published in Germany the book, "[Q1193108: The%20Ego%20and%20Its%20Own]", which would later be considered an influential early text of [Q7076: individualist%20anarchism]. French anarchists active in the [Q3588: Revolutions%20of%201848] included [Q2852478: Anselme%20Bellegarrigue], Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque and Proudhon himself.
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [Q3588: revolutions%20of%201848], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, [0: conservative] elements took advantage of the divided groups of [Q7272: Socialism], [Q6216: Liberalism] and [Q6235: Nationalism] along with anarchists to prevent further revolt. In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal "El Porvenir" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas. The Catalan politician [Q450271: Francesc%20Pi%20i%20Margall] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became President of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the [Q3125165: Federal%20Democratic%20Republican%20Party]. According to George Woodcock: "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's". According to the "[Q455: Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica]": "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall [0: Cantonal%20Revolution] on Proudhonian lines".
In 1864, the [Q183725: International%20Workingmen%27s%20Association] (sometimes called the First International) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, [Q881698: Blanquism], [Q961731: Philadelphes], English trade unionists, socialists and [Q121254: Social%20democracy]. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. [Q9061: Karl%20Marx] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [Q844212: Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29], opposed Marx's [Q3963246: state%20socialism], advocating political [Q13580111: abstentionism] and small property holdings. Woodcock also reports that the [Q6025357: Individualist%20anarchism%20in%20the%20United%20States] [Q538091: Lysander%20Spooner] and [Q855938: William%20Batchelder%20Greene] had been members of the First International. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [Q3240447: League%20of%20Peace%20and%20Freedom] (LPF) Russian revolutionary [Q27645: Mikhail%20Bakunin] and his [0: collectivist%20anarchist] associates joined the First International, which had decided not to get involved with the LPF. They allied themselves with the [Q5440576: federalist] socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property. At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [Q1757356: centralism] and predicted that if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [Q385166: ruling%20class] they had fought against.
Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports: "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers". In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [Q2632679: Hague%20Congress%20%281872%29], where Bakunin and [Q116617: James%20Guillaume] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [Q574863: Anarchist%20St.%20Imier%20International], adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.
The [Q133132: Paris%20Commune] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included [Q216092: Louise%20Michel], the Reclus brothers ([Q1227381: %C3%89lie%20Reclus] and [Q20951: %C3%89lis%C3%A9e%20Reclus]) and [0: Eugene%20Varlin] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised. Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. The Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 and for federation of communes), thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. George Woodcock states that "a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elisée Reclus and Louise Michel".
The [Q1030234: Anti-authoritarianism] sections of the First International were the precursors of the [Q188993: Anarcho-syndicalism], seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labour". In 1886, the [Q5440868: Federation%20of%20Organized%20Trades%20and%20Labor%20Unions] of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 as the date by which the [Q341050: Eight-hour%20day] would become standard.
In response, unions across the United States prepared a [Q49775: general%20strike] in support of the event. On 3 May, a fight broke out in Chicago when [Q1340502: strikebreaker]s attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day on 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [Q214148: Haymarket%20affair] and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890, a second attempt—this time international in scope—to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of [Q47499: International%20Workers%27%20Day] on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.
In 1907, the [Q1667692: International%20Anarchist%20Congress%20of%20Amsterdam] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which were important figures of the anarchist movement, including [Q215673: Errico%20Malatesta], [Q3087687: Pierre%20Monatte], [Q2569930: Luigi%20Fabbri], [Q2896447: Beno%C3%AEt%20Broutchoux], [Q79969: Emma%20Goldman], [Q213562: Rudolf%20Rocker] and [Q249042: Christiaan%20Cornelissen]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [Q538925: popular%20education] issues, the general strike or [Q506674: antimilitarism]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [Q49780: syndicalism] (or [Q178790: trade%20union]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [Q2279967: social%20revolution] while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade union movement was [Q878445: reformism] and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
In 1881, the [Q952769: Federaci%C3%B3n%20Anarquista%20Ib%C3%A9rica] was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement—anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [Q550420: Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo] (National Confederation of Labour, CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [Q10859: Spanish%20Civil%20War]. The CNT was affiliated with the [0: International%20Workers%20Association], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular, "[t]he anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [Q1254135: Anarchism%20in%20Mexico], [Q2794076: Anarchism%20in%20Brazil], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organisations was the [0: Federaci%C3%B3n%20Obrera%20Regional%20Argentina] [...] it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions".
Some anarchists, such as [Q213632: Johann%20Most], advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda". Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder, but [0: targeted%20killings] of members of the [Q385166: ruling%20class] at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed. However, Most himself once boasted that "the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion". Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885, "The Science of Revolutionary Warfare", a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey.
By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, [Q1475448: regicide]s and [Q1369583: tyrannicide]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal "[Q275038: Confiscation]". [Q1516296: Illegalism] as a practice emerged and within it "[t]he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("[0: propaganda%20by%20the%20deed]") and the anarchist burglars ("[0: individual%20reappropriation]") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt". France's [Q892839: Bonnot%20Gang] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
However, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts as soon as 1887. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist [Q1383791: Fernand%20Pelloutier] argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter".
[Q1899269: Political%20repression] (including the infamous 1894 French "[Q844749: lois%20sc%C3%A9l%C3%A9rates]") of the anarchist and [Q208701: labour%20movement]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed in the first place to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [0: socialist%20movement] into many groups and—following the suppression of the 1871—Paris Commune the execution and exile of many "[Q1780490: communards]" to [0: penal%20colonies] favoured individualist political expression and acts.
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar [Q83171: Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia], President [Q215778: Marie%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Sadi%20Carnot] of France, Prime Minister [Q336901: Antonio%20C%C3%A1novas%20del%20Castillo] of Spain, [Q150782: Empress%20Elisabeth%20of%20Austria], King [Q153688: Umberto%20I%20of%20Italy], President [Q35041: William%20McKinley] of the United States, King [Q158874: Carlos%20I%20of%20Portugal] and King [Q17142: George%20I%20of%20Greece]. McKinley's assassin [Q348187: Leon%20Czolgosz] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [Q7252: Feminism] Emma Goldman.
Anarchists participated alongside the [0: Bolshevik]s in both [Q101534: February%20Revolution] and [Q42976: October%20Revolution] and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution. However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 [Q208300: Kronstadt%20rebellion], which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to [Q212: Ukraine]. In the [Q1436243: Free%20Territory], they fought in the [Q79911: Russian%20Civil%20War] against the [Q104309: White%20movement] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and [Q195390: Alexander%20Berkman] were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Bakunin's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example and [Q233591: Communist%20party] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [Q1125638: General%20Confederation%20of%20Labour%20%28France%29] and [Q1046722: Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World] (IWW) left the organisations and joined the [0: Comintern].
The [Q7318933: Revolutions%20of%201917%E2%80%931923] saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the [Q170306: German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319]19 which established the [Q58738: Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic], the anarchists [Q61723: Gustav%20Landauer], [Q22755: Silvio%20Gesell] and [Q61722: Erich%20M%C3%BChsam] had important leadership positions within the revolutionary [Q933306: Council%20communism] structures. In the Italian events known as the "[0: biennio%20rosso]", the anarcho-syndicalist trade union [Q1734052: Unione%20Sindacale%20Italiana] "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "[0: Umanita%20Nova]", its daily paper) grew accordingly [...] Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces." In the [Q214426: Mexican%20Revolution], the [Q613206: Mexican%20Liberal%20Party] was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in [Q58731: Baja%20California] with the leadership of anarcho-communist [Q146948: Ricardo%20Flores%20Mag%C3%B3n].
In Paris, the [Q768301: Dielo%20Truda] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the "[Q176339: Platformism]", was supported. [0: Platformist] groups active today include the [Q8034816: Workers%20Solidarity%20Movement] in Ireland and the [0: NEFAC] of North America. [Q3508949: Synthesis%20anarchism] emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of [Q486271: anarchism%20without%20adjectives]. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents [Q715195: Volin] and [0: Sebastien%20Faure]. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global [Q133795: International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations].
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [Q5436685: fascism%20in%20Europe] transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and [Q23559: Benito%20Mussolini]'s [Q6223: Fascism]. Italian anarchists played a key role in the [Q210189: Anti-fascism] organisation "[Q639533: Arditi%20del%20Popolo]", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [Q846081: Blackshirts] in the anarchist stronghold of [Q2683: Parma] in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution". In France, where the [Q3240332: far-right%20leagues] came close to insurrection in the [Q3002755: 6%20February%201934%20crisis], anarchists divided over a [Q1307777: united%20front] policy.
[Q892502: Anarchism%20in%20France] and [Q4751636: Anarchism%20in%20Italy] were active in the [Q2094191: Resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II]. In Germany, the anarchist [Q61722: Erich%20M%C3%BChsam] was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the [Q153992: Reichstag%20fire] in Berlin. [Q41749: Joseph%20Goebbels], the [Q7320: Nazi%20Party] [Q158689: Reich%20Ministry%20of%20Public%20Enlightenment%20and%20Propaganda], labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives". Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at [0: Sonnenburg], Brandenburg and finally, [Q14808: Oranienburg]. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the [Q328468: Nazi%20concentration%20camps] at [Q119720: Oranienburg%20concentration%20camp] when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an [Q486236: Anarchism%20in%20Spain] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [Q1492: Barcelona] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [Q4314084: Collective%20farming] the land. However, the anarchists were losing ground even before the fascist victory in 1939 in a bitter struggle with the [Q179121: Stalinism], who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the [Q3456351: Republican%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29] cause from the [Q15180: Soviet%20Union]. According to [Q9049: Noam%20Chomsky], "the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere. The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the [Q178038: Second%20Spanish%20Republic] and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because [Q855: Joseph%20Stalin] still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against [Q352: Adolf%20Hitler]. That failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves". The events known as the [Q1982745: Spanish%20Revolution%20of%201936] was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the [Q10859: Spanish%20Civil%20War] in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly [Q1852084: Libertarian%20socialism] organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily [Q5705: Catalonia], [Q19839854: Anarchist%20Aragon], [Q5783: Andalusia] and parts of [Q857294: Levante%2C%20Spain]. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [Q478811: Communist%20Party%20of%20Spain] influence as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, [Q11451: Agriculture] areas became collectivised and run as libertarian [Q517760: commune]s. Anarchist historian [Q2467449: Sam%20Dolgoff] estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history". Spanish Communist Party-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both [Q668699: POUM] and anarchists. The prominent Italian anarchist [Q969881: Camillo%20Berneri], who volunteered to fight against [Q29179: Francisco%20Franco] was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party. The city of [Q2807: Madrid] was turned over to the Francoist forces by the last non-francoist mayor of the city, the anarchist [Q1407986: Melchor%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Garc%C3%ADa].
Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the [Q4751636: Anarchism%20in%20Italy%23Postwar%20years%20and%20today] and [Q892502: Anarchism%20in%20France%23The%20Fourth%20Republic%20%281945%E2%80%931958%29]. The [Q6825747: Mexican%20Anarchist%20Federation] was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District. In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime. In 1945 in France the [0: F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Anarchiste] and the anarchosyndicalist trade union [Q1125627: Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20nationale%20du%20travail] was established in the next year while the also [0: Synthesist%20anarchism] [0: Federazione%20Anarchica%20Italiana] was founded in Italy. Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the [Q6158096: Japanese%20Anarchist%20Federation] was founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948. After World War II, an appeal in the "[0: Fraye%20Arbeter%20Shtime]" detailing the plight of [Q486213: Anarchism%20in%20Germany] and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ, "Die Freie Gesellschaft", which survived until 1953. In 1956, the [Q3036261: Uruguayan%20Anarchist%20Federation] was founded. In 1955, the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the [Q936517: Argentine%20Libertarian%20Federation]. The [0: Syndicalist%20Workers%27%20Federation] (SWF) was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of [Q5802634: Solidarity%20Federation]'s earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain (AFB). Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as [Q34670: Albert%20Camus], [Q460061: Herbert%20Read], Paul Goodman, Dwight Macdonald, [Q6711: Allen%20Ginsberg], George Woodcock, [Q113659: Leopold%20Kohr], [Q1332885: Julian%20Beck], [Q180727: John%20Cage] and the French [Q39427: Surrealism] group led by [Q161955: Andr%C3%A9%20Breton], which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.
[Q486371: Anarcho-pacifism] became influential in the [Q574580: Anti-nuclear%20movement] and [0: anti%20war%20movement]s of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of [Q178511: Campaign%20for%20Nuclear%20Disarmament] [Q621458: Alex%20Comfort] or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists [Q4747270: Ammon%20Hennacy] and [Q150281: Dorothy%20Day]. Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the [Q8683: Cold%20War]". The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's , "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".
A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the [Q2995893: Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s] and anarchists actively participated in the [Q257758: Protests%20of%201968]. In 1968, in [Q13372: Carrara], Italy the [Q133795: International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations] was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the [0: F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20anarchiste]), the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the [0: Iberian%20Anarchist%20Federation] as well as the [Q219: Bulgaria]n federation in French exile.
In the United Kingdom in the 1970s, this was associated with the [Q3071: punk%20rock] movement as exemplified by bands such as [Q842336: Crass] and the [Q82545: Sex%20Pistols]. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, [0: squatter]s occupied a disused military base and declared the [Q202206: Freetown%20Christiania], an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid-20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [Q211380: anarcha-feminism], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist [Q1174579: David%20Graeber] and anarchist historian [0: Andrej%20Grubacic] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by [Q1428168: Traditional%20knowledge], [Q7252: Feminism], ecological and cultural-critical ideas" and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.
Since the 1980s, anarchism has grown into a strong political force in [Q12585: Latin%20America], with the development of [Q5441608: Fejuve] (1979), [0: CIPO-RFM] (1980s), [Q9046610: Rebel%20Zapatista%20Autonomous%20Municipalities] (1994), [Q5115965: December%202001%20riots%20in%20Argentina] (2001) and the [Q1519341: 2006%20Oaxaca%20protests] (2006). Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and [0: anti-globalisation%20movement]s. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [Q7825: World%20Trade%20Organization] (WTO), [Q37143: Group%20of%20Eight] (G8) and the [Q170418: World%20Economic%20Forum] (WEF). Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as [Q690153: black%20bloc]s—other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [Q7445029: security%20culture], [Q1643970: affinity%20group]s and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [0: World%20Trade%20Organization%20Ministerial%20Conference%20of%201999%20protest%20activity]. According to anarchist scholar [Q923743: Simon%20Critchley], "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [0: neo-liberalism] [...] One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally".
International anarchist federations in existence include the [Q133795: International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations], the [Q1394961: International%20Workers%27%20Association] and [Q649752: International%20Libertarian%20Solidarity]. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the [0: Confederacion%20General%20del%20Trabajo%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a] (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.
Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [Q619829: Democratic%20Federation%20of%20Northern%20Syria] (DFNS), more commonly known as [0: Rojava], a "de facto" [Q3575763: Permanent%20autonomous%20zone] in northern [Q858: Syria]. [Q191530: Abdullah%20%C3%96calan]—a founding member of the [Q152220: Kurdistan%20Workers%27%20Party] (PKK) who is currently imprisoned in [Q43: Turkey]—is an iconic and popular figure in the DFNS whose ideas shaped the region's society and politics. While in prison, Öcalan corresponded with (and was influenced by) [Q315910: Murray%20Bookchin], an [0: anarcho-communist] theorist and philosopher who developed [Q2705134: Communalism] and [Q507238: libertarian%20municipalism]. Modelled after Bookchin's ideas, Öcalan developed the theory of [Q1186368: democratic%20confederalism]. In March 2005, he issued his "Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan", calling upon citizens "to stop attacking the government and instead create municipal assemblies, which he called '[Q370919: Social%20anarchism]'".
[Q1278791: Anarchist%20schools%20of%20thought] had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [Q7076: individualist%20anarchism] and [Q370919: social%20anarchism], which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [Q536814: negative%20liberty], i.e. opposition to state or [Q623971: social%20control] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [Q831359: positive%20liberty] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, "recognising equality of entitlement". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools—those created since the mid-20th century and after.
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [Q778779: philosophical%20anarchism], which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [Q750630: Minarchism] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a [Q31011: moral%20obligation] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "anarchism without adjectives", a call for [Q183225: toleration] first adopted by [Q1374294: Fernando%20Tarrida%20del%20M%C3%A1rmol] in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [0: anti-authoritarian] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
[Q844212: Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29] began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order." Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers' movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned [Q4539: cooperative]s, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service.
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [Q3264987: Reciprocity%20%28cultural%20anthropology%29], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist [Q855938: William%20Batchelder%20Greene], each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount". Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property".
[Q370919: Social%20anarchism] calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or [Q325980: coercion]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism. Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for [Q499094: personal%20property]) and emphasises cooperation and [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].



[Q38404: Autism]

Autism is a [Q3087172: developmental%20disorder] characterized by troubles with [0: social%20interaction] and [Q11024: communication], and by restricted and repetitive [Q9332: behavior]. Parents usually notice signs during the first two or three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their [0: developmental%20milestones] at a normal pace before [Q3445377: Regressive%20autism].
Autism is associated with a combination of [Q3145036: Heritability%20of%20autism] and [0: environmental%20factors]. Risk factors during pregancy include certain [Q166231: infection]s such as [Q155857: rubella], and certain toxins like [0: valproic%20acid], [Q47146337: Alcohol%20%28drug%29], [Q41576: cocaine], [0: pesticides] and [Q131123: air%20pollution]. [Q5165981: Controversies%20in%20autism] surround other proposed environmental [Q2543343: Causes%20of%20autism]; for example, the [Q10862691: MMR%20vaccine%20controversy], which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the [Q1073: brain] by altering how [0: nerve%20cell]s and their [Q187181: synapse]s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the [Q3064664: DSM-5], autism and less severe forms of the condition, including [Q161790: Asperger%20syndrome] and [Q3288122: pervasive%20developmental%20disorder%20not%20otherwise%20specified] (PDD-NOS), have been combined into the diagnosis of [0: autism%20spectrum%20disorder] (ASD).
[Q621607: Applied%20behavior%20analysis] and [0: speech%20therapy] can help children with autism gain [Q27258541: self-care], social, and communication skills. Although there is no known [Q1571900: cure], there have been cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some are successful. An [Q2908193: Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism] has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be [Q2920250: Autism%20rights%20movement].
Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. In the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide. In the [0: developed%20countries], about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD , a more than doubling from 0.7% in 2000 in the United States. It occurs four-to-five times more often in boys than girls. The number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.
Autism is a highly variable [Q3450985: neurodevelopmental%20disorder] that first appears during [Q998: Infant] or [Q276258: childhood], and generally follows a steady course without [0: Remission%20%28medicine%29]. People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [0: autism%20spectrum%20disorder]s (ASD; see [0: %23Classification]) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [Q232810: Temple%20Grandin] described her inability to understand the [Q6701907: social%20communication] of [Q1079090: neurotypical]s, or people with normal [0: neural%20development], as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".
Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [0: social%20norms]; for example, they have less [Q633546: eye%20contact] and [Q2313343: turn-taking], and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate [Q42417308: nonverbal%20autism]ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form [0: Attachment%20%28psychology%29] to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less [Q13405610: Attachment%20in%20children%23Secure%20attachment] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD [Q529895: Face%20perception%23Face%20perception%20in%20individuals%20with%20autism] although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.
There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and [Q2622052: tantrum]s.
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [Q1723890: babbling], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([Q937353: echolalia]) or [Q7249952: Pronoun%20reversal]. [Q9636076: Joint%20attention] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from [Q22909000: splinter%20skill]s such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious [Q467265: Savant%20syndrome]. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. [0: Sensory%20system] abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include [Q1753547: Hypotonia], [Q498916: Apraxia], and [Q1097541: toe%20walking]; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.
Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in [Q12167: malnutrition]. Although some children with autism also have [0: gastrointestinal%20symptom]s, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.
Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of [0: stress%20%28psychological%29]. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with [Q47715: Down%20syndrome] in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with [Q47715: Down%20syndrome]; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [Q3145036: Heritability%20of%20autism] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare [Q42918: mutation]s with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and [0: epigenetic] factors which do not change [Q7430: DNA] sequencing but are heritable and influence [Q26972: gene%20expression]. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.
Studies of twins suggest that [Q1503548: heritability] is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a [0: Mendelian] (single-gene) mutation or to a single [Q744962: chromosome%20abnormality], and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous [Q7625067: structural%20variation] — such as [Q656732: Deletion%20%28genetics%29], [Q746284: Gene%20duplication] or [Q1070877: Chromosomal%20inversion] in genetic material during [Q162925: meiosis]. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition.
Several lines of evidence point to [Q187181: Synapse] dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with [Q187640: cell%20adhesion]. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known [0: teratogen]s (agents that cause [Q727096: birth%20defect]s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from [Q2666904: Human%20fertilization], and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.
Exposure to [Q131123: air%20pollution] during pregnancy, especially [0: heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29] and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. [Q2142347: Environmental%20factor]s that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, [0: infectious%20disease]s, [Q146505: solvent]s, [0: PCBs], [0: phthalates] and [Q407142: phenols] used in plastic products, [Q131656: pesticide]s, [Q2723553: brominated%20flame%20retardant]s, [Q153: Ethanol], smoking, [0: illicit%20drug]s, [Q134808: vaccine]s, and [Q7240529: prenatal%20stress]. Some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven.
Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming [0: Vaccine%20controversy%23Vaccine%20overload], a [Q3689384: Thiomersal%20controversy], or the [Q10862691: MMR%20vaccine%20controversy] for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of [0: childhood%20immunizations], [Q10862691: MMR%20vaccine%20controversy%23Disease%20outbreaks] in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.
Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the [Q1135939: pathophysiology] of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the [0: neuropsychological] linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.
Unlike many other brain disorders, such as [0: Parkinson%27s], autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms. Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product. [0: Neuroanatomical] studies and the associations with [0: teratogens] strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors. Just after birth, the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism. It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization. Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following:
The [Q1059: immune%20system] is thought to play an important role in autism. Children with autism have been found by researchers to have [Q101991: inflammation] of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory [0: cytokines] and significant activation of [Q1622829: microglia]. Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication. Interactions between the [Q1059: immune%20system] and the [Q9404: nervous%20system] begin early during the [Q964797: Human%20embryogenesis] of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is thought that activation of a pregnant mother's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development. This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism.
The relationship of [Q15197465: neurochemical]s to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of [Q167934: serotonin] and of genetic differences in its transport. The role of group I [0: metabotropic%20glutamate%20receptors] (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of [Q221472: fragile%20X%20syndrome], the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway. Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several [Q190199: growth%20hormone]s or to impaired regulation of [Q118226: growth%20factor%20receptor]s. Also, some [Q1758393: inborn%20errors%20of%20metabolism] are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.
The [0: mirror%20neuron%20system] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions. Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD. However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the [0: default%20network] (a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing), with intact connectivity of the [Q5298764: task-positive%20network] (used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking). In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of [0: self-referential] thought.
The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes. Evidence for this theory has been found in [Q1004354: functional%20neuroimaging] studies on autistic individuals and by a [Q179965: Electroencephalography] study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the [Q75839: Cerebral%20cortex] and weak functional connections between the [Q749520: frontal%20lobe] and the rest of the cortex. Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each [Q551808: Cerebral%20hemisphere] of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the [0: Association%20areas].
From studies based on [Q14026181: event-related%20potential]s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli. For example, [Q384188: magnetoencephalography] studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.
In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and [Q41112: schizophrenia] based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with [Q209049: 1q21.1%20deletion%20syndrome]. Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive.
Two major categories of [0: cognitive] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.
The first category focuses on deficits in [Q1432778: social%20cognition]. [Q918343: Simon%20Baron-Cohen]'s [Q3526910: empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing%20theory] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing. These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier [Q639219: theory%20of%20mind] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the [Q1059391: Sally%E2%80%93Anne%20test] for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in "[0: %23Pathophysiology]" maps well to the hypothesis. However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.
The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the [Q783092: executive%20functions] such as [Q11337567: working%20memory], planning, [0: Inhibition%20Theory]. In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of [Q5419936: executive%20dysfunction] as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism". Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.
[Q2366980: Weak%20central%20coherence%20theory] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people. A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [0: perceptual] operations in autistic individuals. Yet another, [Q6902050: monotropism], posits that autism stems from a different cognitive style, tending to focus attention (or processing resources) intensely, to the exclusion of other stimuli. These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.
[Q177719: Medical%20diagnosis] is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the [Q3064664: DSM-5], autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or [Q171841: Idiosyncrasy%23Psychiatry%20and%20psychology], and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [Q917357: Rett%20syndrome], [Q183560: intellectual%20disability] or global developmental delay. [Q45127: ICD-10] uses essentially the same definition.
Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [0: Autism%20Diagnostic%20Interview-Revised] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [Q4822673: Autism%20Diagnostic%20Observation%20Schedule] (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The [Q2424099: Childhood%20Autism%20Rating%20Scale] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.
A [0: pediatrician] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [0: medical%20conditions]. A pediatric [0: neuropsychologist] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A [Q837512: differential%20diagnosis] for ASD at this stage might also consider [Q183560: intellectual%20disability], [0: hearing%20impairment], and a [Q775593: specific%20language%20impairment] such as [Q1636310: Landau%E2%80%93Kleffner%20syndrome]. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [Q42844: Major%20depressive%20disorder].
[0: Clinical%20genetics] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [0: fragile%20X] testing. A [Q25326541: Genotype-first%20approach] model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. [0: Metabolic] and [Q551875: neuroimaging] tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.
Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [0: visually%20impaired], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [0: blindism]s.
Autism is one of the five [Q6691991: pervasive%20developmental%20disorder]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.
Of the five PDD forms, [Q161790: Asperger%20syndrome] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [Q917357: Rett%20syndrome] and [Q388722: childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [0: PDD%20not%20otherwise%20specified] (PDD-NOS; also called "atypical autism") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [Q2330667: language%20development]. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) or sometimes the "autistic disorders", whereas autism itself is often called "autistic disorder", "childhood autism", or "infantile autism". In this article, "autism" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, "autism", "ASD", and "PDD" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism [Q104053: phenotype], which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like [0: Trait%20%28biology%29], such as avoiding eye contact.
The manifestations of autism cover a wide [Q7575316: Spectrum%20disorder], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [0: developmentally%20disabled], and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, [0: pedantic] communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or [Q1788847: high-functioning%20autism] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [0: IQ] thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into [Q179630: Syndrome] and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound [Q183560: intellectual%20disability] or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as [Q1362721: tuberous%20sclerosis]. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the [Q5270337: Diagnosis%20of%20Asperger%20syndrome%23Differences%20from%20high-functioning%20autism] is unclear.
Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that [Q3445377: regressive%20autism] is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.
Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of [Q7867: psychiatry], [Q9418: psychology], [Q83042: neurology] and [Q123028: pediatrics]. Newer technologies such as [0: fMRI] and [0: diffusion%20tensor%20imaging] can help identify biologically relevant [Q104053: phenotype]s (observable traits) that can be viewed on [0: brain%20scan]s, to help further [0: neurogenetic] studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the [Q2624677: fusiform%20face%20area] of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.
The [Q7891198: United%20States%20Preventive%20Services%20Task%20Force] in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns. The Japanese practice is to [Q1163564: Screening%20%28medicine%29] all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the [Q25053794: Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers] (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on [Q25053794: Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers] and its predecessor, the [Q25313014: Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers] (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low [0: Sensitivity%20%28tests%29] (many false-negatives) but good [0: Specificity%20%28tests%29] (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although [0: genetic%20screening] for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and [Q1269290: dysmorphic%20feature]s.
While infection with [Q155857: rubella] during [Q11995: pregnancy] causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism, [Q7375928: rubella%20vaccine] can prevent many of those cases.
The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Services should be carried out by [Q16000502: Professional%20practice%20of%20behavior%20analysis], [Q212105: special%20education] [0: teachers], [Q33226: speech-language%20pathology], and licensed [0: psychologists]. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about [Q2585693: efficacy]. However, the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many [Q3410145: psychosocial] interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of [Q1504425: systematic%20review]s of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained [Q212105: special%20education] programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social communication, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability or hyperactivity.
Educational interventions often used include [Q621607: applied%20behavior%20analysis] (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, [0: speech%20and%20language%20therapy], [Q1413287: social%20skills] therapy, and [Q380141: occupational%20therapy]. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)—over thirty hours per week of [Q5326835: discrete%20trial%20training] (DTT) for children younger than five—is currently low, and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include [Q5326835: Discrete%20trial%20training] and [Q2193694: Pivotal%20response%20treatment] ABA interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.
[Q5326835: Discrete%20trial%20training] has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children, and is well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. Similarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more [Q2193694: Pivotal%20response%20treatment] combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.
Medications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. They may also be used for associated health problems such as [0: ADHD] or [Q544006: anxiety%20disorder]. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed [Q3706669: psychoactive%20drug]s or [Q576618: anticonvulsant]s, with the most common drug classes being [Q76560: antidepressant]s, [Q211036: stimulant]s, and [Q208144: antipsychotic]s. The [Q758295: atypical%20antipsychotic] drugs [Q412443: risperidone] and [Q411188: aripiprazole] are [0: Food%20and%20drug%20administration]-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.
Although many [Q4736560: Alternative%20therapies%20for%20developmental%20and%20learning%20disabilities] are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in [Q13100823: Quality%20of%20life] contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on [0: casein-free%20diet]s; in 2005, botched [Q1069061: chelation%20therapy] killed a five-year-old child with autism. Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is [Q55606327: CEASE%20therapy], a mixture of [Q81058: homeopathy], supplements, and 'vaccine detoxing'.
Although popularly used as an [0: complementary%20and%20alternative%20medicine] for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a [Q2632776: gluten-free%20diet] is of benefit. In the subset of people who have [Q19772377: non-celiac%20gluten%20sensitivity] there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors. There is tentative evidence that [Q209642: music%20therapy] may improve social interactions, verbal communication, and non-verbal communication skills. There has been early research looking at [Q731615: Hyperbaric%20medicine]s in children with autism.
The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism. Through this movement, people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease. Proponents of this movement wish to seek "acceptance, not cures." There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as [Q736974: World%20Autism%20Awareness%20Day], [Q6546037: Light%20It%20Up%20Blue], [Q4826016: Autism%20Sunday], [Q613276: Autistic%20Pride%20Day], [0: Autreat], and others. There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone's life. These organizations include [Q784658: Autism%20Speaks], [Q4825999: Autism%20National%20Committee], [Q4826013: Autism%20Society%20of%20America], and many others. Social-science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about "autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons... and research on social movements." Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism. "[Q188845: Rain%20Man]", a film that won 4 Oscars including Best Picture, depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities. While many autistics don't have these special abilities, there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields.
Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ ([Q192472: net%20present%20value] in dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% [0: medical%20care], 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that [Q1455871: child%20care] problems will greatly affect parental employment. US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance. After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and [Q5400688: estate%20planning].
There is no known cure. Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Most children with autism lack [Q2297111: social%20support], meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or [Q1433910: Self-determination%20theory]. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.
Few high-quality studies address long-term [Q592442: prognosis]. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an [0: IQ] above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; [Q1373709: independent%20living] is unlikely with severe autism. Most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood.
Most recent [Q265158: review]s tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true rate. Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people as of 2015, while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. In 2012, the [Q918396: National%20Health%20Service] estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of [0: PDD-NOS]'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and [Q388722: childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder] at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC's most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children, or 14.7 per 1,000, has an ASD as of 2010.
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The "[Q3661047: Table%20Talk%20%28Luther%29]" of [Q9554: Martin%20Luther], compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The [0: Wild%20Boy%20of%20Aveyron], a [Q258146: feral%20child] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [Q386551: Jean%20Marc%20Gaspard%20Itard] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.
The [Q1248221: New%20Latin] word "autismus" (English translation "autism") was coined by the [Q124216: Swiss%20people] psychiatrist [Q115506: Eugen%20Bleuler] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [Q41112: schizophrenia]. He derived it from the Greek word "autós" (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".
The word "autism" first took its modern sense in 1938 when [Q78512: Hans%20Asperger] of the [Q180080: Vienna%20General%20Hospital] adopted Bleuler's terminology "autistic psychopaths" in a lecture in German about [0: child%20psychology]. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [Q161790: Asperger%20syndrome], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. [Q93592: Leo%20Kanner] of the [Q1472068: Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital] first used "autism" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label "early infantile autism" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.
[Q24951318: Donald%20Triplett] was the first person diagnosed with autism. He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as "case 1". Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords.
Kanner's reuse of "autism" led to decades of confused terminology like "infantile schizophrenia", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "[0: refrigerator%20mother]s". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.
As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed, parents continue to feel [Q1137326: social%20stigma] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many [Q55379489: primary%20care%20physician]s and [0: medical%20specialist]s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.
It took until 1980 for the [0: DSM-III] to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the [0: DSM-III-R] provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the [Q3064664: DSM-5] was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including [0: PDD-NOS], autism, [Q161790: Asperger%20syndrome], [Q917357: Rett%20syndrome], and [Q388722: Childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder], has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.
The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. [Q2908193: Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that [Q2915349: Neurodiversity].



[Q101038: Albedo]

Albedo () (, meaning "whiteness") is the measure of the [Q1154504: diffuse%20reflection] of [Q193788: sunlight] out of the total [0: solar%20radiation] received by an [0: astronomical%20body] (e.g. a [Q634: planet] like [Q2: Earth]). It is [0: dimensionless%20number] and measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [Q161424: black%20body] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).
Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see [Q1653577: position%20of%20the%20Sun]). While bi-hemispherical [Q663650: reflectance] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.
Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation. Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [Q76299: visible%20spectrum] (0.39–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).
Albedo is an important concept in [Q52139: climatology], [Q333: astronomy], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [Q1521623: Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its "planetary albedo", is 30–35% because of [Q830457: cloud%20cover], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.
The term albedo was introduced into optics by [Q122999: Johann%20Heinrich%20Lambert] in his 1760 work "[Q7187829: Photometria]".
Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [Q161424: black%20body]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of [Q2: Earth] is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [Q1348989: Earth%20observation] satellite sensors such as [Q23548: NASA]'s [0: MODIS] instruments on board the [Q584697: Terra%20%28satellite%29] and [Q17397: Aqua%20%28satellite%29] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [Q3294876: Suomi%20NPP] and [Q6269319: Joint%20Polar%20Satellite%20System]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [Q5280441: directional-hemispherical%20reflectance] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,). These calculations are based on the [Q856980: Bidirectional%20reflectance%20distribution%20function], which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.
Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [Q41560: greenhouse%20effect] is currently about 15 °C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 °C. If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 °C. In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water — a so-called aquaplanet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 °C.
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [Q7556691: solar%20zenith%20angle] "θ" can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, formula_1, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, formula_2, with formula_3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and formula_4 being the proportion of diffuse illumination.
[Q5280441: Directional-hemispherical%20reflectance] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [Q4902346: bi-hemispherical%20reflectance] as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.
The albedos of [Q634: planet]s, [Q2537: Natural%20satellite] and [Q1022867: minor%20planet]s such as [Q3863: asteroid]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [Q1073340: photometry%20%28astronomy%29]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [Q544: Solar%20System] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [Q106551: regolith] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [Q3863: asteroid]s.
[Q3303: Enceladus], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is [Q611: Eris%20%28dwarf%20planet%29], with an albedo of 0.96. Many small objects in the outer Solar System and [Q2179: asteroid%20belt] have low albedos down to about 0.05. A typical [Q1773534: comet%20nucleus] has an albedo of 0.04. Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily [Q1570174: space%20weathering] surface containing some [Q174211: organic%20compound]s.
The overall albedo of the [Q405: Moon] is measured to be around 0.136, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong [0: opposition%20effect]. Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [Q106551: regolith] surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.
Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [Q2832068: geometric%20albedo] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [Q2731139: Bond%20albedo] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.
In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [Q5651619: Hapke%20parameters] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [Q2059855: phase%20angle%20%28astronomy%29], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [Q106551: regolith] surfaces.
The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [Q159653: Absolute%20magnitude%23Absolute%20magnitude%20for%20planets%20%28H%29] and diameter is:
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local [Q216973: insolation] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [Q25322: arctic] and [Q1555938: antarctic] regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the [0: Sahara%20Desert], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. [0: Tropical] and [0: sub-tropical] [Q9444: rainforest] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [Q3079197: temperate%20forest] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.
Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [Q2: Earth]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [Q7561: snow] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [0: Ice-albedo%20feedback] results in a reduced albedo effect.
Albedo affects [Q7937: climate] by determining how much [Q18335: radiation] a planet absorbs. The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [Q11663: weather].
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [Q183635: feedback] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [Q216823: air%20mass]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [Q11663: weather] is dynamic due to the change of [Q24384: season]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [Q216973: insolation]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. Over [Q51: Antarctica] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [Q918004: positive%20feedback]).
Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback. Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of [Q7942: Global%20warming].
[Q1745101: Cryoconite], powdery windblown [Q165632: dust] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.
Albedo can affect the [Q206799: electrical%20energy] output of solar [Q1897785: photovoltaic%20system]s. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%. More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [Q76299: visible%20spectrum] is absorbed through [Q11982: photosynthesis]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of [Q169940: deforestation]). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect. Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [Q828158: evapotranspiration]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate 
In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [0: Deciduous%20trees] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [0: coniferous%20trees] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.
Studies by the [0: Hadley%20Centre] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [Q15305550: carbon%20sequestration] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [Q838055: Fresnel%20equations] (see graph).
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [Q1079524: specular%20reflection] (not [Q1154504: Diffuse%20reflection]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [Q1196575: angle%20of%20incidence%20%28optics%29] light, [Q5241941: waviness] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.
Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [Q331824: terminator%20%28solar%29] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.
[Q1798127: Cloud%20albedo] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."
Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [Q207546: contrail]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.
[0: Aerosols] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [Q906347: cloud%20condensation%20nuclei] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain. As per the effects are:
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [Q3233590: black%20carbon] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [Q171183: Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m. Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.
[Q77607: Single-scattering%20albedo] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([Q174102: refractive%20index]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.



[Q9659: A]

A ([Q754673: English%20alphabet%23Letter%20names] , plural "As", "A's", "a"s, "a's" or "aes") is the first [Q9788: Letter%20%28alphabet%29] and the first [Q36244: vowel] of the [Q5974462: ISO%20basic%20Latin%20alphabet]. It is similar to the [Q8216: Greek_alphabet%23History] [Q9887: alpha], from which it derives. The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in [Q344098: italic%20type].
The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is [Q15033: aleph] (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the [Q26752: Phoenician%20alphabet], which consisted entirely of [Q38035: consonant]s (for that reason, it is also called an [Q185087: abjad] to distinguish it from a true [Q9779: alphabet]). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [Q52827: pictogram] of an ox head in [Q1065250: proto-Sinaitic%20script] influenced by [Q132659: Egyptian%20hieroglyphs], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.
By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the [Q33513: Hebrew%20alphabet] or [Q1828555: Arabic%20script] aleph.
When the [Q11772: Ancient%20Greece] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the [Q178034: glottal%20stop]—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in [Q36734: Phoenician%20language] and other [Q34049: Semitic%20languages], and that was the first [Q8183: phoneme] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of [Q9887: alpha]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [Q210443: Greek%20Dark%20Ages], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [Q8216: Greek%20alphabet] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.
The [Q17161: Etruscan%20civilization] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [Q145694: Italian%20Peninsula] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [Q4891256: Old%20Italic%20script] to write the [Q397: Latin], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [Q8229: Latin%20script] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" media. There was also a [Q1079418: cursive] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [Q8188561: letter%20case] cursive, [Q8188561: letter%20case] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [Q784235: Uncial%20script%23Half-uncial], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.
